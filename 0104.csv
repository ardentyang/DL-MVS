However, the existing methods are either based on artificial analytical modeling or signal analysis, which is challenging to model and needs better portability or the model needs to be simplified to implement online applications. Therefore, this article proposes a data-driven fault diagnosis and high-performance online inference method. The diagnosis method simplifies the traditional labeling method by designing labels and takes one-dimensional depth separable convolution (1D-DSC) and global max pooling (GMP) to replace conventional 1-D convolution and local pooling called 1D-DSCNN-GMP. Then, the model is compressed and optimized based on the TensorRT framework. Experiments show that compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can reduce the number of model parameters by more than 90%. The average online inference time of the model after compression and deployment to the edge computing board (ECB) is about 1 ms, only 5% fundamental period, and can maintain 100% diagnostic accuracy, with better online application potential. © 2013 IEEE.","Depth separable convolution; edge computing board (ECB); fault diagnosis; global maximum pooling; neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverter; online application; TensorRT","Convolution; Edge computing; Electric inverters; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Interactive computer systems; Timing circuits; Adaptation models; Circuit faults; Computational modelling; Depth separable convolution; Edge computing; Edge computing board; Faults diagnosis; Field programmable gate array; Field programmables; Global maximum; Global maximum pooling; Inverter; Neutral-point clamped inverters; On-line applications; Programmable gate array; Real - Time system; Tensorrt; Real time systems","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In data-driven fault diagnosis, feature extraction is usually performed through a combination of one-dimensional time domain or frequency domain analysis methods. However, the constraints of data format and diagnostic methods give rise to three primary issues: inadequate utilization, expression, and mining of fault features, thereby impeding the broader application of data-driven methods. This paper presents a fault diagnosis framework that integrates cross-domain fusion images and a lightweight feature-enhanced network to address these issues. We leverage the temporal and frequency features of raw time series data, transforming them into images. This approach not only offers a greater amount of fault information but also highlights the inherent features more prominently. In terms of diagnosis methods, a novel feature-enhanced network model is proposed. This model takes images generated by a cross-domain image fusion module as inputs and then goes through a customized feature extraction module, a feature fusion module, a feature enhancement module, and a classification module to achieve high-precision and fast fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of this framework is validated on two publicly available datasets. The results show that the average accuracy of this fault diagnosis framework can reach 100%, surpassing the findings of existing research. The experiments on noise resistance further showcase the superiority of the proposed framework. It is expected that the framework presented in this study will provide a new perspective and direction for fault diagnosis. © 2023","Convolutional neural network; Data processing; Fault diagnosis; Vibration signals","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data handling; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Frequency domain analysis; Image enhancement; Image fusion; Metadata; Time domain analysis; Convolutional neural network; Cross-domain; Data-driven fault diagnosis; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Fusion image; Fusion modules; High-accuracy; Hot topics; Vibration signal; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In industry, varying equipment conditions lead to different data distributions, making it challenging to maintain consistent fault diagnosis performance across conditions. To this end, this paper designs a transfer learning model named the multi-adversarial joint distribution adaptation network (MAJDAN) to achieve effective fault diagnosis across operating conditions. MAJDAN uses a one-dimensional lightweight convolutional neural network (1DLCNN) to directly extract features from the original bearing vibration signal. Combining the distance-based domain-adaptive method, maximum mean difference (MMD), with the multi-adversarial network will simultaneously reduce the conditional and marginal distribution differences between the domains. As a result, MAJDAN can efficiently acquire domain-invariant feature information, addressing the challenge of cross-domain bearing fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the model was verified based on two sets of different bearing vibration signals, and one-to-one and one-to-many working condition migration task experiments were carried out. Simultaneously, various levels of noise were introduced to the signal to enable analysis and comparison. The findings demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves exceptional diagnostic accuracy and exhibits robustness. © 2023 by the authors.","deep transfer learning; intelligent diagnosis; multi-adversarial domain adaptation; rolling bearing","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, the existing literature mostly focuses on identifying the fault patterns, whereas the assessment of fault deterioration before it reaches the extreme degradation state has been less investigated. In this article, a hybrid structure combining 2-D convolution neural network (2DCNN) and long-short term memory/gated recurrent unit (LSTM/GRU) has been modeled as a relatively lightweight flat diagnosis structure (FDS) for early fault identification and its severity assessment simultaneously in converter-fed induction motor. Initially, the hierarchical layers of 2DCNN extract the effective features automatically for fault detection and its severity identification simultaneously. Then, these features are presented as suitable inputs to LSTM/GRU for classification. A comparative evaluation of the proposed hybrid method with the standalone structure, namely, 2DCNN, LSTM, and support vector machine (SVM), proves the advantages of the proposed scheme and its applicability for both fault diagnosis and fault severity assessment in industrial drive systems, under variable frequencies and load variations. © 2022 IEEE.

Nonetheless, most approaches rely on the availability of source data, which is always unattainable in many practical industrial scenarios due to the costs of expensive data storage and transmission as well as privacy protection. As a consequence, there is an urgent need to design an adaptation method that is independent of source data. This technology is also more in line with the requirements for lightweight and timely diagnosis. Given this, in this article, we develop a novel source-free adaptation diagnosis (SFAD) method. In SFAD, a robust self-training mechanism and a target prediction matrix constraint are presented, achieving model adaption with only unlabeled target data.

However, the uncertainties including environmental stresses and own physical and chemical variations lead to an infinite number of fault degrees of fault components, and the fault identification of complex systems in practical engineering applications faces the challenge of fluctuating operating conditions due to variations of rotational speed and load. To address the above problem, a fault location method based on ensemble complex spatio-temporal attention network (ECSAN) is proposed in this paper, which can identify the critical fault components of complex systems by combining an ensemble learning mechanism with excellent basic estimators. A basic estimator consists of a feature extraction module, a feature enhancement module, and a classification module. In the first module, a complex spatio-temporal backbone network with strong generalization is developed to provide spatio-temporal features containing the inherent information of the sample data for complex systems. In the feature enhancement module, a lightweight complex attention layer is constructed to enhance the effective structural information of the features and reduce the interference of their redundant information. The classification module then adopts a Softmax layer to perform fault classification. Finally, an ensemble learning mechanism is designed to integrate the basic estimators. By constructing sample weights and introducing a knowledge transfer strategy, the generalization is further improved while saving training expenses. Two datasets from different experimental platforms are concerned to verify the effectiveness and superiority of this method under various operating conditions and fault degrees. The experimental results indicate that this method achieves 99.81% accuracy on a standard dataset of the mechanical system and 98.88% accuracy on a real dataset of the closed-loop control system of the water jet propulsion device, which is superior to comparison approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Attention mechanism; Complex network; Ensemble learning; Fault location; Fluctuating operating conditions","Closed loop control systems; Complex networks; Fault detection; Knowledge management; Location; Attention mechanisms; Ensemble learning; Fault component; Fault identifications; Feature enhancement; Fluctuating operating condition; Learning mechanism; Location method; Operating condition; Spatio-temporal; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus"

First, the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was introduced, which can strengthen the extraction of useful features from the data, thereby improving the network feature extraction efficiency. Second, the residual structure was optimized, and the original multilayer convolution was simplified to a single-layer convolution, which reduces the complexity of the model and improves the diagnostic efficiency. Then, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function in the model was replaced with the better-performing exponential linear unit (ELU) activation function. Finally, the overall structure of the residual network (ResNet) model was optimized. The CBAM-ResNet network model was based on the traditional ResNet18 model and consists of a CBAM module and the optimized ResNet18 model. Finally, experiments were using sensor data collected from rolling bearing test benches.

Accurate fault diagnosis and state evaluation are of great significance to ensure safe and stable operation of power system.Deep learning method has become the mainstream in the field of fault diagnosis, but traditional convolution neural network requires powerful computing resources and is hard to be used in the intelligent terminal devices with average computing ability. Therefore, a kind of insulation and mechanical fault diagnosis method for GIS based on lightweight convolution neural network was proposed in this paper.Firstly, the spatially separable convolution was used to replace the traditional convolution to construct the EffNet lightweight convolution neural network, which effectively reduces the calculation of the model. Secondly, model training was implemented by using transfer learning strategies, which speeds up the accuracy of network recognition and accelerates the convergence rate of the model at the same time, and the problem of insufficient field data was solved. Finally, the convolution neural network features were visualized by t-distribution random neighboring embedding and the performance of model was verified further. The research results show that the accuracy of the lightweight network model with 5 EffNet convolution blocks is 94.7% and 98.7% respectively in the insulation and mechanical fault diagnosis, which reduces remarkably the reference quantity, storage and computing overhead.The method proposed in this paper is suitable for GIS intelligent components and detection instruments, which is the best choice for the embedded system and mobile terminal in power internet of Things. © 2023 Xi'an High Voltage Apparatus Research Institute.

Nevertheless, in engineering practice, limited labelled data, and various working conditions seriously hinder the widespread application of most deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods. Besides, increasingly complex networks for obtaining powerful feature representation are difficult to deploy in the industry, due to the problem of model efficiency. To address these problems, a novel lightweight relation network (NLRN) is proposed in this paper. The lightweight encoder module in NLRN achieves a strong feature extraction capability with fewer parameters, which means higher model efficiency. Furthermore, a calibration method based on semi-supervised learning is designed to alleviate domain shift due to cross-domain problems, as well as to improve the unreliability of relation networks in few-shot problems. We choose rolling bearings as the research object and three bearing datasets are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.

Labeled compound fault samples are very rare or even unavailable in industrial scenarios. Thus, it is a challenging task to decouple the compound fault and detect the compound fault with unequal severity only utilizing single faults. In this article, an untrained planetary gearbox compound fault diagnosis method based on adaptive learning variational mode decomposition (ALVMD) and dual-scale squeeze-and-excitation convolutional neural network (DSSECNN) is proposed. An ALVMD algorithm is established to enhance weak fault characteristics and enrich the diversity of sample information. The DSSECNN intelligent fault diagnosis model is presented, and the lightweight SENet can enhance the sensitivity of the model to channel features. Moreover, the mapping relationship between the compound fault mode and single faults is revealed through the proposed probability formula, which can reduce the dependence of the training model on compound fault samples. Experiments have been performed on the gearbox fault experiment bench in the laboratory to verify the effectiveness and generalization performance of the method. Besides, wind turbine gearbox test results show that the ALVMD-DSSECNN can achieve the highest average accuracy of 98.83% compared with other related methods in variable working conditions, which has a certain guiding significance for practical engineering.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; squeeze-and-excitation network (SENet); untrained compound fault; variational mode decomposition (VMD); wind turbine gearbox","Convolution; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Gears; Neural networks; Compound; Compound faults; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; SENet; Untrained compound fault; VMD; Wind turbine gearboxes; Wind turbines","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In the field of fault diagnosis, intelligent diagnosis methods based on deep learning have shown great advantages in accuracy and efficiency. However, as the network depth and scale increase, the exponentially growing model computation and parameter amounts require higher hardware requirements for computers, making it difficult to deploy on embedded platforms with limited computing resources. This makes it difficult for deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods to be applied in practical industrial settings that emphasize real-time performance, portability, and accuracy. This paper proposes a network lightweight method based on knowledge distillation (KD). Using the two-dimensional time-frequency map of vibration signals as the model input, the improved MobileNet-V3 network is used as the teacher network, and the simplified convolutional neural network is used as the student network (SN). The method of KD is applied to condense the knowledge and transfer it to the SN. The proposed method is validated using an RV reducer fault simulation experiment platform, and the results show that the proposed method reduces computation and parameter amounts by about 170 times at an accuracy rate of 94.37%, and run time is shortened by nearly one-third, and a generalization verification was conducted using the rotating mechanical fault simulation experiment platform. The models were also deployed on embedded devices to verify that the method proposed in this paper effectively reduces the deep learning network model’s demand for hardware resources of the operating environment.

Inspired by the acoustic manipulation capabilities of acoustic metamaterials, this study proposes a method for weak gear fault feature diagnosis via gradient acoustic metamaterial (GAM), which utilises the acoustic rainbow capture and compression ability to reduce the difficulty of gear incipient fault diagnosis. According to the gear frequency modulation/amplitude modulation modulation principle, enhancement of fault feature frequencies can be achieved by collecting gear acoustic signals from the selected air gaps in GAM structure. In this study, the feasibility of GAM-based gear weak fault feature diagnosis is proved by experiments, which verify the multiscale feature denoising and frequency selective enhancement characteristics of GAM. The results show that the amplitude of the target signal is amplified more than eight times, the sideband component containing the fault signal is enhanced obviously, and the effect of denoising outside the target sideband is evident, making the fault feature can be easily identified from the weak fault signal after demodulation. By comparing with digital filtering in traditional signal processing, this method is more straightforward in extracting weak gear fault features. Additionally, this method adopts non-contact measurement method with micro-electroMechanical system (MEMS) microphone, which has advantages over acceleration sensors in overcoming the space limitation. All in all, the proposed method is effective and facilitates the identification of weak gear faults. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","frequency selectivity enhancement; gearbox fault feature; gradient acoustic metamaterial; multiscale feature denoising","Failure analysis; Fault detection; MEMS; Metamaterials; Acoustic metamaterial; De-noising; Fault feature; Frequency selectivity enhancement; Frequency-selectivity; Gearbox fault feature; Gradient acoustic metamaterial; Multi-scale features; Multiscale feature denoising; Selectivity enhancement; Gears","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, existing continual learning methods have the following limitations. (1) They manually detect new faults, which is labor-intensive, untimely, and more importantly, may lead to mistaken diagnosis results. (2) They adopt the traditional knowledge distillation to align the absolute responses of old and new models, which alleviates catastrophic forgetting but restricts flexible learning from incremental datasets. To overcome the above limitations, this paper proposes a novel self-driven continual learning framework for class-added motor fault diagnosis, which can spontaneously detect unseen faults and perform more flexible continual learning from incremental datasets. For the automatic detection of unseen faults, after collecting online samples, adversarial training with exemplars of each seen class is conducted to measure the class separability. The truth fault classes that are unseen for diagnosis models can be clearly distinguished from all seen classes, and correspondingly missed diagnosis or misdiagnosing can be avoided effectively and incremental samples with new fault types can be collected quickly. For the flexible continual learning strategy, a more flexible knowledge distillation is proposed to preserve the prediction propensity rather than the absolute response. This strategy not only keeps the recognition performance of old classes but also loosens unnecessary constraints and increases the diagnosis model plasticity to learn new knowledge from incremental datasets, thus improving the accuracy of motor fault diagnosis during continual learning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by conducting fault simulation experiments of three-phase motors and its superiority is also demonstrated by comparing it with some state-of-the-art diagnosis methods. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Adversarial training; Continual learning; Motor fault diagnosis; Propensity distillation; Unseen fault detection","Distillation; Failure analysis; Learning systems; Adversarial training; Continual learning; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Incremental datasets; Motor fault; Motor fault diagnose; Propensity distillation; Self-driven; Unseen fault detection; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Existing mechanical IFD methods cannot continuously learn and integrate new diagnostic knowledge. In engineering, new fault data is continuously collected over time, and it is costly to retrain IFD models when new fault mode data arrives. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new adaptive incremental diagnosis model (AIDM) with incremental capabilities. The AIDM is composed of a feature extraction module, an exemplar library, and a series of linear classifiers. By adding new output nodes and adopting knowledge distillation loss, the quick reconstruction and updating of AIDM can be realized on the premise of avoiding catastrophic forgetting. In addition, to solve the stability-plasticity dilemma, a new dynamic weight correction algorithm is proposed to dynamically adjust the biased weight of different linear classifiers.

However, there are still two challenges in gearbox fault diagnosis methods based on deep learning: (1) limited failure sample; (2) interference of strong noise. To solve the above issues, a lightweight multiscale convolutional neural network (LMSCNN) based fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. Among them, a large kernel convolution is used to denoise the original vibration signal. A lightweight multiscale architecture is constructed using depthwise separable convolutional blocks, which mine fault features at different scales and improve the operational efficiency of the model. Moreover, a parallel global pooling block is designed to provide a more comprehensive feature for the fusion layer, enabling the effective diagnosis of vibration signals.

Deep learning techniques have demonstrated outstanding potential for real-time monitoring of bearings, contributing to the safe operation of machinery and equipment.

However, convolutional neural networks are not suitable for industrial applications due to their large model size and high computational complexity. To address this limitation, this paper proposes the Antisym module and constructs AntisymNet, which is combined with dimension expansion algorithms for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. To begin with, the original vibration signal of the rolling machinery is subjected to time-frequency transformations using the discrete Fourier transform and discrete wavelet transform. Subsequently, each transformed time-frequency signal is expanded in dimensions, resulting in two-dimensional matrix single channel images. These single channel images are then fused into RGB images to enhance the sample features. Finally, the proposed AntisymNet is utilized for recognizing and classifying the expanded signals. To evaluate the performance of AntisymNet, the MiniImageNet image dataset is employed as a benchmark, and a comparison is made with other state-of-the-art lightweight convolutional neural networks. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis model is validated using the CWRU bearing dataset, Ottawa bearing dataset, and the hob dataset. The model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.70% in the CWRU dataset, 99.26% in the Ottawa dataset, and an error rate of only 0.66% in the hob dataset.

Cloud-based techniques have been previously adopted for fault diagnosis in Gearboxes. Cloud-based fault diagnosis methods are prone to time delays and loss of information. Therefore, edge computing-based fault diagnosis becomes an option. However, with limited hardware resources for edge devices, balancing the diagnostic capabilities of the model with operating performance becomes a challenge. This paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network for gearbox fault diagnosis in edge computing scenarios to achieve an accurate diagnosis and lightweight deployment of models. By constructing the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) feature matrix of input data, the methodology can suppress noise interference and improve diagnostic accuracy. Based on the structural re-parameterization, the model structure transforms from multiple branches at training time to a single branch at inference time. This improves the inference speed of the model and reduces the hardware cost when the model is deployed while ensuring that the diagnostic capability of the model remains unchanged. Validation experiments were conducted on a public dataset and a custom experimental device, using the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX kit as the edge computing platform. According to the experiment result, after extracting the MFCC feature matrix, the average diagnostic accuracy rate in the noisy environment of the presented methodology is improved by 12.22% and 9.44%, respectively.

Therefore, it is difficult to form a lubricating oil film while most of the surface of the shaft is unprotected, resulting in serious wear and a high failure rate.

The prompt monitoring of a bearings’ condition is critical for the reduction of mechanical accidents. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in recent years, machine learning-based intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) methods have achieved remarkable success in the field of bearing condition monitoring. However, most algorithms are developed based on computer platforms that focus on analyzing offline, rather than real-time, signals. In this paper, an edge intelligence diagnosis method called S-AlexNet, which is based on a parameter transplantation convolutional neural network (CNN), is proposed. The method deploys the lightweight IFD method in a low-cost embedded system to monitor the bearing status in real time. Firstly, a lightweight IFD algorithm model is designed for embedded systems. The model is trained on a PC to obtain optimal parameters, such as the model’s weights and bias. Finally, the optimal parameters are transplanted into the embedded system model to identify the bearing status on the edge side. Two datasets were used to validate the performance of the proposed method. The validation using the CWRU dataset shows that the proposed method achieves an average prediction accuracy of 94.4% on the test set. The validation using self-built data shows that the proposed method can identify bearing operating status in embedded systems with an average prediction accuracy of 99.81%. The results indicate that the proposed method has the advantages of high recognition accuracy, low model complexity, low cost, and high portability, which allow for the simple and effective implementation of the edge IFD of bearings in embedded systems. © 2023 by the authors.","bearings; CNN; edge computing; embedded systems; intelligent fault diagnosis","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The SE module enhances the extraction of the key feature in the model and the MSFs module improves the feature extraction capability of the model with less calculation cost. The experimental verification is carried out on the rolling bearing fault datasets of Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and Yanshan University (YSU). The accuracy of the proposed model can reach more than 99% under different datasets. Compared with other models, the computation parameters and floating point of operations (FLOPs) are reduced to varying degrees. The model achieves lightweight while ensuring great fault diagnosis accuracy.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Attention mechanism; channel shuffle; dilated convolution; fault diagnosis","Convolution; Cost engineering; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Roller bearings; Attention mechanisms; Channel shuffle; Computational modelling; Dilated convolution; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Kernel; Multi-scale features; Rolling bearings; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The running speed can be constantly changing to switch the working mode with the excessive background noise. Among them, three-phase induction motor bearings tend to suffer multiple concurrent failures and strong interference of background noise in the signal. The sparse decomposition of composite fault signals can also be doped by various fault types. The sparse characteristics of the signals cannot be fully reflected, due to the large atomic complexity and the low sparse performance. It is a high demand for the accurate diagnosis of the weak composite fault of bearings. In this study, a hybrid fault diagnosis was proposed using the non-convex fused lasso model (NCFLM). The sparse performance of non-convex total variation denoising (NCTVD) was improved to accurately identify the faults when extracting the weak compound faults of three-phase induction motor bearings. Among them, the absolute value function of the coefficient difference was used as the punishment to compress the model coefficient. The regression coefficient was then compressed toward the origin. The coefficient with the redundancy characteristics was weakened to smooth and segment the coefficient with similar characteristics. The number of atoms was reduced with less information and the complexity of the signal, in order to meet the requirements of the ideal recognition of compound faults. Firstly, the Generalized minimax concave (GMC) was introduced into the NCTVD model (arctan-NCTVD) using the arctan-NCTVD penalty factor. The GMC penalty function was derived from the generalization of the Huber function. The form of the GMC penalty function was derived by the variable scaling, whereas, the compression scaling variables were added to the unary Huber. The GMC penalty function term was added to the arctan-NCTVD model, and then expanded into the form of a fusion lasso model, in order to obtain the NCFLM. The penalty control was simultaneously carried out on the signal data atoms themselves. The sum of the absolute values was set as the differences between NCFLM and conventional non-convex penalty model. There was a decrease in the difference between adjacent atoms with the same characteristics. The sequential association of all atoms was also considered to distinguish different feature components. As such, the processed data by the fusion lasso model was sparse for the atoms and continuity differences between them. Therefore, sparse solutions were generated between atoms and continuity differences. The sparsity of the sparse coefficient and the difference was enhanced to make the model more sensitive to the complex impact components in the signal. Secondly, the model was solved using the Forward-Backward Algorithm (FBA). The ergodic method was introduced to find the optimal value of the regularization parameters λ1 and λ2, when the maximum correlation kurtosis was obtained. The ergodic method was used to screen the optimal regularization parameter combination with the strong convexity of the model. The improved non-convex penalty model was achieved in better sparse performance and approximation to the ideal L0 norm. Finally, the NCFLM processing was carried out using the collected composite fault signals of motor bearings to extract the composite fault characteristics. The measured data was obtained in the variable frequency and speed regulating three-phase asynchronous motor bearings. The experimental results show that the sparse performance of NCFLM was 9.2%, 6.6%, 10%, 46.2%, and 15% higher than that of the original arctan-NCTVD model, in terms of the atomic distribution, convergence performance, reconstruction error, sparsity and degree of approximation to L0 norm. It can also accurately diagnose the compound fault of motor bearings that is caused by the local damage of outer and inner rings, indicating the feasibility and engineering practicability of the improved model. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

The sound signal generated by transformer contains a large amount of effective information that reflects equipment status, thus the loose fault can be diagnosed online based on the characteristic map of sound signal. First, four kinds of characteristic maps were constructed, including the time-domain characteristic map extracted by Grammy angle field, the frequency-domain characteristic map extracted by Fourier and Markov transition fields, the time-frequency domain characteristic map extracted by wavelet transform, and the chaotic characteristics map extracted by recursive analysis. Then, a lightweight convolutional neural network model was constructed, where four kinds of characteristic maps were selected as input and the effective fault features were extracted through convolution and pool operation. Finally, the looseness degree of winding fault was directly determined by classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reliably diagnose the winding faults with looseness of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, and the average accuracy rate is 99. 6% . Even for the moderate 25% looseness, the accuracy rate can also reach 98% . Compared with the accuracy of method using only one map, that of the proposed method is improved by 9. 9% .

However, statistical heterogeneity caused by non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) fault data is a ubiquitous problem. Previous methods designed for this problem mainly apply weighted averaging or knowledge distillation to integrate biased local knowledge from clients, ignoring the discrepancy between knowledge extracted from non-IID data solely. This is prone to result in slow and unstable model convergence and global model drift. In this article, a Federated Knowledge Amalgamation (FedKA) framework is proposed to alleviate the knowledge discrepancy caused by statistical heterogeneity. To mitigate the knowledge discrepancy, we first reveal and mine unbiased public knowledge for industrial fault diagnosis, i.e., fault attributes, which describe the fault characterization and mechanism without changing with data distribution. Then, a generative mapping between unbiased fault attributes and fault data is established for clients to incorporate unbiased knowledge into the diagnostic model. Moreover, to mitigate knowledge discrepancy and overcome the global model drift, a knowledge amalgamation algorithm is designed. Through the proposed layer-wise alignment, the multi-level fault semantic knowledge that stems from fault attributes is finely exploited and aggregated. Additionally, unlike the common fixed weighting strategy, we explore an adaptive weighting mechanism through the sample-wise diagnostic confidence to further alleviate the global model drift. Extensive experiments on a real thermal power plant process demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for federated fault diagnosis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud–edge collaboration; Fault attributes; Federated fault diagnosis; Knowledge amalgamation; Statistical heterogeneity","Distillation; Fault detection; Semantics; Thermoelectric power plants; Cloud–edge collaboration; Fault attribute; Fault data; Faults diagnosis; Federated fault diagnose; Global models; Knowledge amalgamation; Model drift; Semantic attribute; Statistical heterogeneities; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In order to solve the problem that rolling bearings are faced with variable operating conditions and the fault features collected are single in actual operation, a new lightweight deep convolution neural network model called FC-CLDCNN, composed of a convolution pooling dropout group with two-stream feature fusion and cross-load adaptive characteristics, is proposed for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. First, the original vibration signal is transformed into a one-dimensional frequency domain signal and a two-dimensional time-frequency graph by fast Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform. Then, the one-dimensional frequency domain signal and two-dimensional time-frequency diagram are input into the two channels of the model respectively to extract and recognize the one-dimensional and two-dimensional features. Finally, the one-dimensional and two-dimensional features are combined in the fusion layer, and the fault types are classified in the softmax layer. FC-CLDCNN has the characteristics of two-stream feature fusion, which can give full consideration to the characteristics of rolling bearing fault data, so as to achieve efficient and accurate identification. The Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) dataset is used for training and testing, and it is proved that the proposed model has high classification accuracy and excellent adaptability across loads.

To realize the fast and accurate recognition of the substation equipment under complex background environments, a method of infrared image recognition based on the lightweight YOLOv5 is proposed. The introduction of the Ghost convolution in the back-bone network makes the network lighter and the detection speed significantly improved. An attention module based on the information interaction strategy between the channels is added to eliminate the interference of the irrelevant information and improve the saliency of the target. In the feature fusion stage, the improved C3 module with self-attention is utilized to enhance the feature capture ability and improve the network accuracy. In addition, the Cluster NMS (non-maximum suppression) and the EIOU(efficient intersection over union) loss are introduced to accelerate the network convergence.

A mechanical system may include multiple submachines in the real-world. During condition monitoring of a mechanical system, fault data are distributed in a continuous flow of constantly generated information and new faults will inevitably occur in unconsidered submachines, which are also called machine increments. Therefore, adequately collecting fault data in advance is difficult. Limited by the characteristics of DL, training existing models directly with new fault data of new submachines leads to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks, while the cost of collecting all known data to retrain the models is excessively high. DL-based fault diagnosis methods cannot learn continually and adaptively in dynamic environments. A new Continual Learning Fault Diagnosis method (CLFD) is proposed in this paper to solve a series of fault diagnosis tasks with machine increments. The stability–plasticity dilemma is an intrinsic issue in continual learning. The core of CLFD is the proposed Dual-branch Adaptive Aggregation Residual Network (DAARN). Two types of residual blocks are created in each block layer of DAARN: steady and dynamic blocks. The stability–plasticity dilemma is solved by assigning them with adaptive aggregation weights to balance stability and plasticity, and a bi-level optimization program is used to optimize adaptive aggregation weights and model parameters. In addition, a feature-level knowledge distillation loss function is proposed to further overcome catastrophic forgetting. CLFD is then applied to the fault diagnosis case with machine increments. Results demonstrate that CLFD outperforms other continual learning methods and has satisfactory robustness. © 2022 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Catastrophic forgetting; Continual learning; Fault diagnosis; Knowledge distillation; Machine increments; Stability–plasticity dilemma","Condition monitoring; Data acquisition; Deep learning; Distillation; Dynamics; Fault detection; Learning systems; Stability; Adaptive aggregation; Catastrophic forgetting; Continual learning; Fault data; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Knowledge distillation; Machine increment; Mechanical systems; Stability-plasticity dilemma; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, detecting this fault early can prevent energy waste and prolong the operating life of the system. However, diagnostic methods are not widely available, and neither are methods to quantify NC amounts based on easily measured variables. Therefore, an experimental test apparatus was built to provide data to improve understanding of NC-refrigerant interactions. Two NC fault intensities (50%, 100%), each at four charge levels (70%, 80%, 100%, 120%), were tested under five different ambient temperatures (0-40°C). Dry nitrogen gas was used for the NC. The results showed that the theoretical estimation method is inaccurate.

Firstly, the original vibration signal is input into the MTF and converted into two-dimensional images with time correlation. Then, in order to effectively aggregate feature information at different scales and levels, a MFA module is presented to capture rich information from feature maps at different scales and assign different weights to these features for fusion. Secondly, while ensuring the lightweight of the model, utilizing feature information of different resolutions, a lightweight feature fusion module is put forward to fuse multiple feature maps together to improve the performance and efficiency of the model.

In this study, a robust and lightweight framework consisting of two lightweight temporal convolutional network (LTCN) backbones and a broad learning system with incremental learning (IBLS) classifier called LTCN-IBLS is proposed for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. The two LTCN backbones extract the fault’s time–frequency and temporal features with strict time constraints. The features are fused to obtain more comprehensive and advanced fault information and input into the IBLS classifier. The IBLS classifier is employed to identify the faults and exhibits a strong nonlinear mapping ability. The contributions of the framework’s components are analyzed by ablation experiments. The framework’s performance is verified by comparing it with other state-of-the-art models using four evaluation metrics (accuracy, macro-recall (MR), macro-precision (MP), and macro-F1 score (MF)) and the number of trainable parameters on three datasets. Gaussian white noise is introduced into the datasets to evaluate the robustness of the LTCN-IBLS. The results show that our framework provides the highest mean values of the evaluation metrics (accuracy ≥ 0.9158, MP ≥ 0.9235, MR ≥ 0.9158, and MF ≥ 0.9148) and the lowest number of trainable parameters (≤0.0165 Mage), indicating its high effectiveness and strong robustness for fault diagnosis. © 2023 by the authors.","broad learning system; fault diagnosis; rotating machinery; temporal convolutional network","Benchmarking; Learning; Manufacturing Industry; Normal Distribution; Spine; Classification (of information); Convolution; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Parameter estimation; Rotating machinery; White noise; Broad learning system; Convolutional networks; Evaluation metrics; F1 scores; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Faults diagnosis; Lightweight frameworks; Metric accuracy; Network backbones; Temporal convolutional network; benchmarking; learning; manufacturing industry; normal distribution; spine; Learning systems","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, due to the complexity of the structure of the aero-engine pipeline systems, the correlation of the coupling, and the multi-source nature of the excitation it is subjected to, the identification of failure characteristics has been an urgent problem in both engineering and academia. In addition, so there is no more qualitative formula or characteristic index to describe the fault of the aero-hydraulic pipeline. Therefore, to overcome these challenges, in this paper, a new compound faults diagnosis framework, namely Lightweight Spatial-Temporal Model Fusion Self-Attention Mechanism (LST-SATM-Net), is proposed for the aero-engine hydraulic pipeline systems. Firstly, the lightweight spatial feature extraction module is designed to extract fine-grained features from aero-engine hydraulic pipeline fault data and the bi-directional temporal feature extraction module is designed to extract coarse-grained features with temporal patterns from fine-grained features, achieving coarse and fine-grained feature fusion. Then, a self-attention mechanism is integrated into the spatial–temporal model for optimization, enabling the model to automatically learn important features from data with multiple sources of coupled vibration excitation, enhancing the performance of critical features from the correlated coupling of compound faults. The powerful noise interference is suppressed and the weighting coefficients are continuously updated to make the final decision more focused. Consequently, the recognition accuracy of the LST-SATM-Net model is improved and the feature learning of the neural network model is more flexible. The results demonstrated that compared with seven other advanced methods, the proposed LST-SATM-Net model is capable of diagnosing compound faults in the hydraulic pipeline system of aero-engine more accurately after being trained by experimental measurement data. This impressive finding indicates that the proposed LST-SATM-Net model can be applied to the actual condition monitoring of aero-engine hydraulic pipelines to reduce maintenance costs and downtime. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Aero-engine hydraulic pipelines; Compound faults diagnose; Lightweight; LST-SATM-net model; Self-attention mechanism","Aircraft engines; Condition based maintenance; Condition monitoring; Data mining; Deep learning; Engines; Extraction; Fault detection; Learning systems; Piping systems; Water pipelines; Aero-engine; Aero-engine hydraulic pipeline; Attention mechanisms; Compound fault diagnosis; Fine grained; Lightweight; LST-SATM-net model; Net model; Pipeline systems; Self-attention mechanism; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Therefore, a lightweight defect detection model L-YOLOv5 is proposed in this paper. First, the residual module in the backbone network is improved for light weight by adding depthwise separable convolution and 1×1 group convolution, and by designing the backbone network L-CSPDarknet53. This network can greatly improve the detection speed without sacrificing a small amount of accuracy. In terms of feature extraction, the DC-SPP module is designed. The convolution and dilated convolution in the module can increase the receptive field and improve the detection performance of the network without losing detailed information. Finally, in accordance with the problem that the self explosion defect area is small and difficult to detect, a method of adding a small target detection layer is proposed. The small target detection layer contains more defect details, which is more conducive to the detection of self explosion defects. The implementation results show that L-YOLOv5 can quickly and accurately detect self explosion defects, with an accuracy of 96.7% and a detection speed of 37.4 frames/s. Compared with YOLOv5 network, the accuracy and speed are improved by 3.5% and 49%, respectively.

Currently, many long-tailed methods have achieved success. However, some methods always improve tail-class performance at the expense of head-class performance due to limited model capability. To address this issue, we propose a novel algorithm-level method inspired by information theory to balance the information space of each class and boost tail-class performance while minimizing head-class sacrifice. Our method involves actively eliminating the redundant feature information of head classes to save space for tail classes during training. Specifically, we use a bilateral-expert model and design a duplicate information disentanglement (DID) module that can extract duplicate and redundant information from bilateral-expert features. This allows us to develop a head diversity loss to decrease the extracted duplicate and redundant information of head classes and a tail distillation loss to increase the label information of tail classes. The joint result of these two losses allows our model to fully leverage the information space for improved tail-class performance without compromising head-class performance.

Current diagnosis methods focus on the analysis of single-scale input images, and the network only accepts fixed-size inputs. The model is not capable of fusing multi-scaled fault features while processing single-scaled images, and compression for the size constraint will cause geometric distortion. This paper proposed a novel fault diagnosis model ReSPP (Residual Network with Least Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LSPP)) based on the improved LSPP. LSPP solves the problem of fault feature distortion caused by fixed-size constraint of the network. By replacing the single-scaled training with the proposed multi-scaled training method applied to fault diagnosis, the weight parameters of ReSPP pool the deep fault features of the bearing-rotor system at multiple scales, retaining the critical fault semantic information. The proposed model solves the fault feature loss in the process of feature extraction by improving the subsampling residual block.

Because the nonlinear characteristics and fault characteristics of electrohydraulic servo systems under noise conditions are implicit, it is difficult to obtain a large number of fault data of electrohydraulic servo valves. Therefore, an electrohydraulic servo valve fault diagnosis model based on characteristic distillation is proposed in this paper. First, the original fault data model is obtained based on an electrohydraulic servo valve fault test platform, the data are standardized, and the data of more than one cycle are extracted using a combination of down sampling and a sliding window for data enhancement. Second, a neural network fault diagnosis algorithm based on stack graph convolution is proposed, which is suitable for detecting different types of states (normal state, wear state, stuck state and coil short-circuit state) of electrohydraulic servo valves. The accuracy of the test set fluctuates between 0.7 and 1.0. Then, because there is a certain relationship between the characteristic smoothing phenomenon of a stack graph convolution model and the number of layers, a multilayer stack graph convolution model is bound to have problems such as model degradation. Therefore, a residual model is introduced into the stack model to improve the convergence speed of the model during the optimization process.

Among PD diagnosis techniques, PD localisation is promising as it can provide target maintenance indicators on the insulation weak points of the cables.

The system consists of two non-invasive and lightweight testing units, which can be conveniently deployed on an energised cable, enabling highly efficient online PD diagnosis of the widely distributed inter-array cables. The system achieves accurate PD localisation of the energised cable via an improved double-sided travelling wave method.

This article proposes a method for calculating the redundancy-reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on strip-median attributes. First, based on the common cause principle, an input-sample-oriented reliability calculation method with automatic boundary detection is constructed to measure the network reliability differences caused by normal classification boundary changes. Next, the adaptive clustering algorithm is used and combined with strip-median attributes to identify the redundant strips of each convolutional layer (CONV) in the networks. Then, based on the central limit theorem and the Pauta criterion, a fault injection method with adaptive convergence ability is constructed to effectively calculate the soft-error-oriented redundancy-reliability of CNNs. The tests of multiple widely used CNNs with multiple datasets showed that with the results of the Monte Carlo (MC) model as the references, the reliability calculation accuracy of the proposed method was approximately 0.9834 and was 3.0% higher than that of the logical flips at bit level (LFBL) method. Additionally, the identification accuracy of the proposed method for redundant nodes in CNNs was better than that of the HRank method and the 1 × N pruning method, by average factors of approximately 14.32 and 1.55× , respectively. Furthermore, the redundant protection and the adaptive layer geometric center searching mechanism designed by the proposed method were effective. Thus, the proposed method can effectively achieve a one-To-one correspondence between the redundancy and reliability of CNNs. © 1993-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); redundancy-reliability; soft error; strip-median attribute","Clustering algorithms; Convolution; Deep neural networks; Error correction; Fault detection; Monte Carlo methods; Radiation hardening; Computer network reliability; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Redundancy-reliability; Soft error; Strip; Strip-median attribute; Termination of employment; Redundancy","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, in practical industrial applications, the complex noise environment affects the performance of the diagnostic model, and the huge model parameters cannot meet the requirements of low cost and high performance in industrial production. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a lightweight intelligent fault diagnosis model using multi-sensor data fusion that not only meets the lightweight requirements of ""small, light, and fast"", but also realizes high accuracy diagnosis in noisy environments. Firstly, the vibration signals from different sensors of rolling bearings are processed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) to design a unique method of constructing grayscale feature maps based on each intrinsic modal function (IMF) component. Then, the ultra-lightweight GoogLeNet model (UL-GoogLeNet) is constructed to adjust the traditional GoogLeNet structure, while the Ultra-lightweight subspace attention module (ULSAM) is introduced to reduce the model parameters and enhance the feature extraction capability. UL-GoogLeNet is trained and tested by dividing the grayscale feature maps into training and testing sets to realize the intelligent recognition of different fault types in rolling bearings.

Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for image classification, and its application in the context of AFDD of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is gaining traction owing to its exceptional performance. However, the deployment cost of deep models in practical scenarios increases owing to the large number of parameters involved. This study uses knowledge distillation to significantly reduce the number of model parameters and the cost of model deployment without compromising the accuracy of AFDD.

With the original intention of promoting the transformation of Transformer from theoretical design to practical engineering application, we designed a lightweight framework with strong robustness, named X-self-attention convolution neural network (XACNN), to meet these challenges. Through the adjustment of FFT, the effectiveness of the preprocessed signal is improved to enhance the robustness to noise, and the goal of lightweight is achieved (FLOP: 0.136 M, Params: 7.663 k) via the optimization of self-attention. To demonstrate the effectiveness, the performance of XACNN in various noise environments was tested on a self-made dataset (average accuracy: 88.525%), which is superior to other methods. Simultaneously, we deployed XACNN on a smartphone as a portable fault diagnosis device, which verified its feasibility.

However, the huge number of parameters is ignored when using large convolutional neural network (CNN), and the input length of different bearings are almost not take into account. The high-energy hardware economic cost and time consumption caused by slow operation of large CNN have brought great difficulties to the engineering practice. Therefore, inspired by envelope demodulation and lightweight network signal processing methods, a novel lightweight TL network is proposed, which can adaptively select the input length (IL) and accurately identify the bearing health states under different work conditions. Firstly, an innovative adaptive IL selection strategy considering bearing differences is proposed to replace manually fixed IL. Secondly, a TL network containing group convolution and instance normalization is constructed to make the network lightweight and operate faster.

Lastly, 81 tasks are carried out on the across-domain datasets to validate the practicability of the proposed method.

However, most technologies for diagnosing bearing faults are based on a constant working speed. The energy change in the spectral kurtosis images of bearings represents the characteristic frequency change of the bearings under time-varying conditions. Considering the running characteristics of rolling bearings under a time-varying speed and taking advantage of the MBConv and Fused-MBConv structures to extract image change features, we built a lightweight network focused on extracting the change features of the spectral kurtosis images of bearings. This paper presents a fault diagnosis method for rolling bearings based on a spectral kurtosis graph and lightweight Fused-MBConv neural network. This end-to-end method can diagnose bearings with not only constant speed but also time-varying speeds. The effectiveness of the method is verified using constant-speed and time-varying-speed bearing datasets. The results show that the accuracy of the rolling bearing diagnosis can reach 98%. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","deep learning; fault diagnosis; rolling bearing; time-varying","Deep learning; Fault detection; Higher order statistics; Roller bearings; Bearing fault; Characteristic-frequency; Constant speed; Deep learning; Energy changes; Faults diagnosis; Rolling bearings; Spectral Kurtosis; Time varying; Working speed; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, a method for diagnosing sensor faults is proposed, which involves using Gramian angular field fusion with particle swarm optimization and lightweight AlexNet. Initially, one-dimensional time series sensor signals are converted into two-dimensional images using the Gramian angular field method with sliding window augmentation. Next, weighted fusion methods are employed to combine Gramian angular summation field images and Gramian angular difference field images, allowing for the full utilization of image information. Subsequently, a lightweight AlexNet is developed to extract features and classify fused images for fault diagnosis with fewer parameters and a shorter running time. To improve diagnosis accuracy, the particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weighted fusion coefficient. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves a fault diagnosis accuracy of 99.72% when the weighted fusion coefficient is 0.276.

However, the multihead self-attention block used by Transformer and cross-channel convolution mechanism existing in CNN would make the collaborative models overly complex, leading to higher hardware requirements and limited industrial application scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a lightweight fault diagnosis framework called LiConvFormer to address the aforementioned challenges. First, a separable multiscale convolution block is designed to extract multilocal receptive field features of vibration signals and greatly reduce the learning parameters and computations. Second, a broadcast self-attention block is developed to capture critical fine-grained features within the signal's global scope, while avoiding cumbersome operations such as matrix multiplication and multidimensional exponentiation. Experimental results on three mechanical systems show that the proposed framework can accommodate advantages of lightweight and robustness compared to the recent Transformer and CNN-based fault diagnosis methods; moreover, the superiority of the above two blocks is also verified.

However, two common drawbacks are: 1) they usually require a large amount of storage resources, making it difficult to run them on embedded devices and 2) there is usually no access to sufficient reliable training data to train a comprehensive diagnosis model. In this study, a fusion approach is proposed based on knowledge distillation and generative adversarial network (GAN). This approach is named small-sample dense teacher assistant knowledge distillation (SS-DTAKD), which aims to enable bearing fault diagnosis with small samples and limited on-board storage resources. First, the proposed self-attention GAN (SGAN) is used to expand the training data for the diagnostic model. The advantage is that the generator and discriminator embedded with the self-attention module can help improve the quality of the generated data. Then, the DTAKD method is proposed to compress the model parameter, where the dense distillation of multiple teacher-assistant networks helps the student network learn correct knowledge without requiring additional data and storage resources. Additionally, the dual-type data hierarchical training (DDHT) method is applied to train the student network, which is designed to utilize actual data to improve the student network's performance. Extensive experiments on two bearing fault datasets demonstrate that the data generated by the SGAN has high similarity and robustness. Furthermore, compared to other existing knowledge distillation methods, the proposed SS-DTAKD method can obtain higher fault diagnosis accuracy with small samples and limited on-board storage resources.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Dense connection; generative adversarial network (GAN); intelligent fault diagnosis; knowledge distillation","Deep learning; Digital storage; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Students; Bearing fault diagnosis; Dense connection; Distillation method; Faults diagnosis; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Knowledge distillation; Small samples; Storage resources; Student network; Teachers'; Distillation","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Experimental results show that compared with original DeepLabv3+, SegNet-ResNet and other methods, mean intersection over union and pixel accuracy and PA of SA-SS are increased by 4.10% and 3.92% respectively. Also, training cost and detection speed are improved by 24.43% and 5.11frame/s respectively. © 2023 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

However, scarcity of high-quality data, especially samples under severe fault states, and variable operating conditions have limited the industrial application of intelligent fault diagnosis. To alleviate this predicament, a novel prior knowledge-embedded meta-transfer learning (PKEMTL) is proposed for few-shot fault diagnosis with limited training data and scarce test data. The method focuses on the problem of few-shot fault diagnosis under variable operating conditions to improve adaptability. Different from traditional models, the PKEMTL employs a metric-based meta-learning framework and embeds prior knowledge to enable cross-task learning under variable operating conditions. Specifically, order tracking is firstly introduced as preliminary prior information for data augmentation, and then the augmented data are divided into a series of meta-tasks. Secondly, the meta-tasks are performed by lightweight multiscale feature encoding to obtain high-level feature representations. Next, the meta-learning module based on diagnostic knowledge embedding guides the model to acquire meta-knowledge of speed generalization by constructing the self-supervised task to embed additional prior knowledge into the meta-training process. The generalization performance of the model is further improved by adaptive information fusion learning as a comprehensive decision-making module. Two case studies under variable operating conditions are implemented to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed few-shot fault diagnosis method. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Few-shot learning; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Meta-transfer learning; Prior knowledge embedding; Variable operating conditions","Decision making; Deep learning; Embeddings; Fault detection; Faults diagnosis; Feature representation; Few-shot learning; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Knowledge embedding; Meta-transfer learning; Prior knowledge embedding; Prior-knowledge; Transfer learning; Variable operating condition; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Unsupervised domain adaptation techniques have been developed to tackle this issue, but they typically demand access to fully labeled source domains, ignoring concerns of privacy regarding source domain data. Therefore, we consider a new research scene for source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), which exclusively relies on a source model trained on source domain sample without requiring access to fully labeled source domain data. This paper introduces a SFUDA approach that utilizes knowledge distillation (KD), which involves two stages: (1) generalizing the source model by applying domain augmentation techniques and LS methods that enhance the model’s potential to enhance its generalization capability; (2) adapting the target model using a KD framework to achieve knowledge migration; and in addition, mutual information structure regularization is added to consider the internal data structure, thus enhancing the model’s adaptability. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we perform experiments on two datasets—the Case Western Reserve University dataset and the Paderborn University dataset, comprising 24 transfer tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the domain augmentation technique, mutual information regularization, and the proposed method. © 2023 The Author(s).

The finite element method was to set up the complete dynamic model of the “ERSFD-rolling bearing-double rotor-casing” by considering nonlinear bearing and oil film forces. Based on the Karhunen-Loeve orthogonal decomposition reduced theories, the reduced-order model of the complete double-rotor systems is obtained. The improved short-time Fourier transform (STFT) + pseudocolor technology and lightweight network mode EfficientNetV2 realize the static eccentricity fault diagnosis and automatic recognition of the ERSFD. The general expression of oil film force and effective reduced-order model are given. The numerical comparison shows that the degree of freedom was reduced to 1/5, and the computational running time was shortened to 1/6 of the full-order model by analyzing the amplitudes and bifurcations at the front and back supports of the casing. It has the highest recognition accuracy and the shorter automatic recognition time of EfficientNetV2 than other network models.

However, the existing fault diagnosis methods often suffer from the problems of one-sided selection of feature parameters and high computational complexity. Aiming at the above limitations, a lightweight fault diagnosis framework towards the turbopump was proposed. In the proposed method, a Hessian local linear embedding (HLLE) algorithm was used to reduce the dimensions of the signals in time-domain,frequency-domain and time-frequency features, and a lightweight deep learning model MLP-Mixer was introduced as a classifier to realize the identification of different fault states.

Their vibration signals are non-linear. The traditional fault diagnosis methods of fans require much calculation and have low operating efficiency. Only shallow fault features can be extracted. As a result, the diagnosis accuracy is not high. It is difficult to realize the end-to-end fault diagnosis. Combining the Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) and lightweight neural network, a fault classification method is proposed. First, the CEEMDAN can decompose the vibration signal into several intrinsic modal functions (IMF). Then, the original signals can be transformed into 2-D images through pseudo-colour coding of the IMFs. Finally, they are fed into the lightweight neural network for fault diagnosis. By embedding a convolutional block attention module (CBAM), the ability of the network to extract critical feature information is improved. The results show that the proposed method can adaptively extract the fault characteristics of a marine centrifugal fan. While the model is lightweight, the overall diagnostic accuracy can reach 99.3%. As exploratory basic research, this method can provide a reference for intelligent fault diagnosis systems on ships. © 2023 Congyue Li et al., published by Sciendo.","CEEMDAN; Fault diagnosis; Lightweight neural network; Marine centrifugal fan","Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Image coding; Adaptive noise; Centrifugal fans; Complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Faults diagnosis; Harsh environment; Lightweight neural network; Marine centrifugal fan; Neural-networks; Vibration signal; Empirical mode decomposition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, due to safety considerations, complex environments and deployment cost constraints in real industrial production, there are still some challenges in the form of edge computing as a vehicle. Therefore, this work proposes a fault diagnosis and distance localization model and deploys the model on edge computing devices for real-time fault diagnosis and distance localization. Lightweight is achieved by modifying the embedding module of the Transformer module as well as self-attention (MFLOPs: 0.487, Params: 6.148 k). Simultaneously, the introduction of Ddformable Concolution in self-attention and multidimensional output in decoding achieves strong robustness (95.92% of accuracy and ± 1.32 cm of error in the noise environments with SNR of −10 dB to 10 dB). Finally, this method was deployed on two edge computing devices for real-time diagnosis (FPS: 34 and 38).

In addition, the model relationships in DCPCA are explored, including the dynamic characteristics of time-series variables and the algebraic ones of static variables. Based on these results, statistics are derived for monitoring both the dynamic and static relationships of the process, and under the abnormal circumstance, by diagnosing the deviations between the fault pattern and the setpoint, a fault regulator for automatic recovery is designed.

However, regarding the complex system in modern manufacturing industry, there are two significant challenges for application development based on profile data mining. First, the staggering data volume leads to high memory and computational requirements. Second, the noisy signals in collected data may deteriorate useful information and model performance. This article proposes a novel algorithm for profile data mining called profile abstract, which simultaneously enables profile data compression and segmentation. The proposed algorithm mainly considers the scenario of fault diagnosis and can be utilized as a pre-processing step to address the above challenges. Profile abstract seeks to find a subset of raw data or a group of models as representatives that preserve the essential characteristics of raw data. Finding the data representatives helps reduce data redundancy while maintaining the model performance. Model representatives assist in describing the complex pattern of the profile, which can be used for pattern-based data segmentation. After data segmentation, information gain is adopted to determine the critical primitives for model improvement. In this article, validation of the proposed method's superiority is performed with two datasets from a real production line and one simulation dataset. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Data compression; fault diagnosis; optimization; primitive extraction; profile data; subset selection","Data compression; Data mining; Data reduction; Fault detection; Process monitoring; Time series analysis; Computational modelling; Faults diagnosis; Manufacturing industries; Modeling performance; Optimisations; Primitive extractions; Profile data; Signal processing algorithms; Subset selection; Time-series analysis; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

With the development of big data processing technology, a new solution, multi-sensor complementary information, has emerged. However, single-scale dimension compression, which is adopted in most multi-sensor data fusion methods, captures only a small amount of valuable information. To deal with this deficiency, a multi-scale dynamic fusion network (MSDFN) is proposed. First, considering the existence of non-stationary features in the fluctuating speed signal, the FReLU function is adopted to activate the features after considering contextual information. Then, multi-sensor features are fused by multiple scales to obtain richer feature information, and fusion features at different scales are weighted by using the attention mechanism. Finally, batch normalization is employed to standardize the variable speed feature distribution. The validity of the MSDFN is proved by conducting fault diagnosis experiments on two bearings under speed fluctuating conditions. Experimental results indicate that the MSDFN is not only effective in identifying various types of fault samples, but also shows higher stability in multiple trials when compared with other methods. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bearing fault diagnosis; fluctuation speed; multi-scale feature fusion; multi-sensor collaboration","Bearings (machine parts); Data handling; Fault detection; Sensor data fusion; Bearing fault diagnosis; Condition; Dynamic fusion; Features fusions; Fluctuation speed; Multi sensor; Multi-scale dynamics; Multi-scale feature fusion; Multi-scale features; Multi-sensor collaboration; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Due to the effectiveness, convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely used in the existing automatic defect detection of PV cells. However, the parameters of these CNN-based models are very large, which require stringent hardware resources and it is difficult to be applied in actual industrial projects. To solve these problems, we propose a novel lightweight high-performance model for automatic defect detection of PV cells in electroluminescence(EL) images based on neural architecture search and knowledge distillation. To auto-design an effective lightweight model, we introduce neural architecture search to the field of PV cell defect classification for the first time. Since the defect can be any size, we design a proper search structure of network to better exploit the multi-scale characteristic. To improve the overall performance of the searched lightweight model, we further transfer the knowledge learned by the existing pre-trained large-scale model based on knowledge distillation. Different kinds of knowledge are exploited and transferred, including attention information, feature information, logit information and task-oriented information. Experiments have demonstrated that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the public PV cell dataset of EL images under online data augmentation with accuracy of 91.74% and the parameters of 1.85M.

The increase of equipment, which needs to be monitored, creates a burden of data transmission, computation, and storage for the traditional cloud diagnosis, and the real-time online diagnosis is later limited because of its large data transmission volume and bandwidth limitation. To address these issues, this study proposed an intelligent edge fault diagnosis system (IEDS) based on a new lightweight, intelligent architecture, which is named 'multiplication-convolution sparse network' (MCSN). First, the first layer of MCSN is carefully designed a series of multiplicative filtering kernels (MFKs) to separate the multiscale fault features distributed in different mono-frequency clusters, which greatly increases the fault identification accuracy of MCSN. The lightweight performance of MCSN enables it to be deployed in edge hardware with limited computing resources. Additionally, oriented to the intelligent edge diagnosis, this proposed MCSN is transplanted to an edge diagnosis unit (EDU) to conduct the designed MC-IEDS. MC-IEDS can complete real-time data acquisition, data processing, fault identification, and fault data filtering at the edge of the equipment, which can consume a large number of low-value density data in the proposed system and improve the real-time performance of fault diagnosis. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate that the lightweight MCSN can achieve a high fault recognition accuracy. The minimum bit width of MCSN is illustrated by fixed-point quantization without loss of accuracy, which is beneficial to the deployment of MCSN into EDU. Meanwhile, online experiments and analysis demonstrated that MC-IEDS can efficiently and accurately achieve edge diagnosis and fault feature filtering at the edge side. With the merits of MC-IEDS in data transmission volume compression and intelligent edge diagnosis with real-time signal filtering, it can be foreseen that the proposed method shows great potential in equipment intelligent fault diagnosis. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Deep learning (DL); edge computing; edge diagnosis system; equipment fault diagnosis; multiplicationâÂ€Â""convolution network","Bandwidth; Convolution; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data transfer; Deep learning; Digital storage; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Quantization (signal); Signal processing; Data-transmission; Deep learning; Diagnose system; Edge computing; Edge diagnose system; Edge faults; Equipment fault diagnosis; Fault-diagnosis system; Multiplication-convolution network; Sparse network; Edge computing","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In order to ensure that CNN focuses on more key information in the one-dimensional signal and reduces the attention to other information, a novel CNN network architecture based on the fusion of multi-sensor information and coordinated attention (CA) is proposed and applied to fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. Further, we studied the interpretability of the proposed network and intuitively revealed the feature learning process and final expression form of the proposed network.

The ropeways can be expected for transporting orchards in mountainous areas. But the harsh working environment can often lead to machine failures in recent years. Therefore, it is of great significance to investigate and solve the problems at the initial stage of failures. Generally, the conventional bearing fault diagnosis system includes five links: signal acquisition, feature extraction, state identification, diagnosis analysis. and decision intervention. Deep learning is widely applied for bearing fault detection in recent years. Traditional machine learning also needs to manually extract the fault features at present, depending mainly on the deep professional knowledge. However, it is high demand for the high performance of fault diagnosis, particularly for simple structures and less calculation during feature extraction. This study aims to realize the fault diagnosis of ropeway drive system bearings in the mountain orchards with poor network environment, in order to ensure the safe and stable operation of ropeway in the mountain orchards. A one-dimensional end-to-end lightweight CNN detection, 1D-MRL-CNN was established to directly detect the one-dimensional vibration signals for the mountain ropeways. Specifically, the new model was established using residual structure and depth separable convolution. The depth separable convolution was applied to greatly reduce the parameter and calculation amount of the improved model. In addition, the residual structure was applied to make up for the accuracy loss caused by depth separable convolution. The parameter amount and complexity of the model were reduced significantly while ensuring the detection accuracy. The stem block and BN layer were then introduced to improve the robustness and generalization ability of the new model suitable for the variable load working state of the ropeway. Finally, the hard_swish activation function was also adopted in the model. The channel attention mechanism was added to the last layer of the main module, in order to improve the feature extraction ability of the network model. Two datasets (Paderborn University and Case Western Reserve University) were used to verify the comprehensive performance, stability under variable load and anti-noise interference performance. The Paderborn University dataset showed that the fault classification accuracy of the improved model was 99.43%, which was 0.56, 0.99, and 1.23 percentage points higher than those of the one-dimensional classical CNN, similar optimal network, and the lightweight CNN architecture optimal network. The parameters and floating-point calculations were 83.44 kb and 0.20 M, which were 2.19%, 1.18%, 0.75%, and 0.83% of the one-dimensional classical CNN classification network architectures (such as Resnet18, Resnet34, Resnet50 and VGG16), 6.19% and 30.40% of the same type of networks 1D-Lenet5 and 1D-Inception, while 4.2%, 2.07%, 2.84%, 3.32% and 5.16% of the one-dimensional lightweight CNN architecture MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, ShuffleNetV1 and EfficientNet-1. In addition, the Case Western Reserve University dataset showed that the average accuracy rate of the improved model was 96.70% in six load scenarios, which was 9.1, 4.7, and 10.5 percentage points higher than those of Resnet18, WDCNN, and MobileNetV3-Large, respectively. The average recognition accuracy was 99.14% under four noise conditions, which was 4.74, 1.24, and 5.51 percentage points higher than those of Resnet18, WDCNN and MobileNetV3-Large, respectively. Finally, the fault classification of the improved model under actual working conditions was verified by the established ropeway dataset, where only 2 fault samples out of 1 400 samples were predicted incorrectly. The new network model was suitable for the bearing fault detection of mountain orchard transport ropeway, due to the small parameters, high accuracy and robustness under variable load and noisy working conditions. © 2023 Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

Although the openness and programmability of SDN ease the construction of large complex networks, it is still challenging to diagnose faults in a complex datacenter-scale network, which is crucial to guarantee rigorous service level agreement (SLA) of upper-layer applications. Previous network diagnosis tools incur significant overhead in fine-grained telemetry, and usually lack the ability to automatically diagnose fine-grained faults. Although on-demand monitoring methods is proposed to reduce telemetry overhead, they struggle to effectively set static thresholds, which requires expert experience. In this paper, we present MARS, a lightweight system for anomaly detection with dynamic threshold and automatic root cause localization in programmable networking systems. MARS collects aggregated packet-level telemetry on demand and generates a ranked list of fine-grained fault culprits at multiple levels, including port-level, switch-level, and flow-level. Experimental evaluations show the cost-effectiveness of MARS, both in terms of network bandwidth and switch memory usage. Moreover, MARS achieves a 0.97 F1 score in anomaly detection, and 0.95 Recall at Top-2 and an overall 0.3 Exam Score in root cause localization. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery.

The time domain vibration data of rolling bearings are transformed by wavelet transform and the time-frequency spectrum can be obtained. The priori labeled public data are used as the source domain and the multi-user unlabeled privacy silos data are used as the target domain. A multi-representation feature extraction architecture is introduced to improve the original residual network, multi-representation features of source domain and target domain are extracted, and multi-user local models are constructed respectively. To enhance the security of the federated framework and reduce the communication overhead, the deep neural network model compression idea is used to improve the parameter transfer strategy in the federated transfer learning framework. A federated global model for rolling bearing fault diagnosis under different working conditions is formulated on the server side.

In our previous research, an enhanced version of DRSN named global multi-attention DRSN (GMA-DRSN) is introduced to augment the feature extraction proficiency of DRSN specifically for noised vibration signals. However, the utilization of multiple attention structures in GMA-DRSN leads to an escalation in the computational complexity of the network, which may pose practical deployment challenges. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a lightweight variant of GMA-DRSN, referred to as lightweight convex global multi-attention deep residual shrinkage network (LGMA-DRSN), building upon our prior work. Firstly, the numerical variation regularity of the adaptive inferred slope parameters in the global parametric rectifier linear unit is analyzed, where we surprisingly find that a convex parameter combination always occurs in pairs. Based on this convex regularity, the sub-network structure of the adaptive inferred slope with attention mechanism is optimized, which greatly reduces the computational complexity compared to our previous work. Finally, the experimental outcomes demonstrate that LGMA-DRSN not only enhances diagnostic efficiency, but also ensures a high level of diagnostic accuracy in the presence of noise interference, when compared with our prior work. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd","attention mechanism; convex; deep residual shrinkage network; fault diagnosis; lightweight","Complex networks; Computational complexity; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Attention mechanisms; Convex; Deep residual shrinkage network; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Lightweight; Lightweight variants; Robust denoising; Variation regularity; Vibration signal; Shrinkage","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Refrigeration devices, either commercial or residential, are responsible for a significant part of net emissions. Based on careful measurements, it is possible to reduce energy consumption in these devices by up to 15% only by improving the fault detection and diagnosis techniques. Thus, improving maintenance programs has become a crucial area in energy management in recent years. Nowadays, the market has experienced a hike after smart systems and new network interfaces applied to smart buildings that have allowed previously isolated devices to become smart devices, interacting with control algorithms smartly and, to some extent, autonomously. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to develop a maintenance policy for mechanical compression refrigeration devices. Firstly, a test bench is built in which each component is assigned to be individually repairable and individually degradable in parallel and interconnected processes. Then, the degradation of the components is combined to formulate the system degradation, and the optimal maintenance policy is modeled via Markov decision processes and solved by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The agent-proposed maintenance program if compared to corrective maintenance, managed to reduce energy use and emissions by around 6% while avoiding shortfalls, as well as about the preventive program, where the agent managed to accomplish the same level of energy efficiency while reducing the maintenance costs by 31% and the time under maintenance in 10%.

Compared with the deep learning methods, the rolling bearing fault diagnosis (RBFD) model based on I-PixelHop has lower computational complexity and smaller model size, and it can obtain a good diagnosis accuracy in the complex working conditions. However, the training and diagnosis time of the RBFD model based on I-PixelHop are still long in the face of large-scale RB fault datasets. Therefore, an efficient I-PixelHop framework based on Spark-GPU for intelligent fault diagnosis is proposed. First, a Spark-GPU-based distributed parallel I-PixelHop framework is developed, which can efficiently perform distributed parallel training and diagnosis. Second, an asynchronous parallel execution strategy based on superscalar pipeline (APES-SP) is proposed, which can reduce the waiting time of each functional unit of the distributed parallel I-PixelHop framework. Finally, an ensemble classifier based on Bagging is designed and parallelized, which can improve the diagnosis accuracy of the RBFD model based on distributed parallel I-PixelHop framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can not only maintain high diagnosis accuracy but also significantly improve the training performance and diagnosis performance of the RBFD model based on I-PixelHop under industrial big data.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Distributed parallelization; fault diagnosis; industrial big data; machine learning; rolling bearing (RB); Spark-GPU cluster","Deep learning; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Graphics processing unit; Large dataset; Learning systems; Roller bearings; Bearing fault diagnosis; Computational modelling; Distributed parallelization; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Industrial big data; Machine-learning; Rolling bearings; Spark-GPU cluster; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, an axial air gap transverse flux machine is presented, and all excitation sources are located in the stator. This structure provides lower core loss, weight and cost due to the full utilisation of the permanent magnets, SMC-free structure and short magnetic flux path. In fact, by combining the features of a flux-switching machine into a transverse flux generator with an axial air gap, it is possible to improve the performance of a direct-drive wind turbine generator by overcoming traditional structures' challenges. To analyse the axial transverse flux switching permanent magnet generator performance characteristics, 3D finite element simulations have been performed, which have been validated by comparing them to the practical results of a single-phase prototype.

In this paper, we present a signal-adaptive asymmetrical autoencoder with a transform domain layer to compress sensor signals. First, a new discrete cosine Stockwell transform (DCST) layer is introduced to replace linear layers in a multi-layer autoencoder. A trainable filter is implemented in the DCST domain by utilizing the multiplication property of the convolution. A trainable hard-thresholding layer is applied to reduce redundant data in the DCST layer to make the feature map sparse. In comparison to the linear layer, the DCST layer reduces the number of trainable parameters and improves the accuracy of data reconstruction. Second, training the autoencoder with a sparsifying DCST layer only requires a small number of datasets. The proposed method is superior to other autoencoder-based methods on the University of Connecticut (UoC) and Southeast University (SEU) gearbox datasets, as the average quality score is improved by 2.00% at the lowest and 32.35% at the highest with a limited number of training samples. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Autoencoder; Discrete cosine stockwell transform; Gearbox sensor data compression; Limited samples; Transform domain layer","Data reduction; Discrete cosine transforms; Gears; Learning systems; Auto encoders; Compression model; Discrete cosine stockwell transform; Discrete cosines; Gearbox sensor data compression; Limited sample; Sensors data; Stockwell transform; Transform domain; Transform domain layer; Data compression","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It is of great significance to develop a lightweight network for gearbox compound fault diagnosis in the edge-IoT context. The goal of this paper is to devise a novel and high-accuracy lightweight neural network based on Legendre multiwavelet transform and multi-channel convolutional neural network (LMWT-MCNN) to fast recognize various compound fault categories of gearbox. The contributions of this paper mainly lie in three aspects: The feature images are designed based on the LMWT frequency domain and they are easily implemented in the MCNN model to effectively avoid noise interference. The proposed lightweight model only consists of three convolutional layers and three pooling layers to further extract the most valuable fault features without any artificial feature extraction. In a fully connected layer, the specific fault type of rotating machinery is identified by the multi-label method. This paper provides a promising technique for rotating machinery fault diagnosis in real applications based on edge-IoT, which can largely reduce labor costs. Finally, the PHM 2009 gearbox and Paderborn University bearing compound fault datasets are used to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight network is able to reliably identify the compound fault categories with the highest accuracy under the strong noise environment compared with the existing methods.","compound fault diagnosis; convolutional neural network; edge-IoT; gearbox; Legendre multiwavelet transform","article; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diagnosis; feature extraction; human; human tissue; internet of things; nerve cell network; noise","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In order to improve the automation and intelligence degree of wear particle detection, a target detection algorithm based on improved YOLOv4 was proposed to automatically extract and identify target particles from wear particle images with complex backgrounds. It overcame the error caused by the traditional method of image segmentation in the face of multi-wear particle images, and was applied to wear particle image recognition in aeroengine Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Firstly, VoVNetv2-39 was used to replace YOLOv4’s original backbone network CSPDarknet53. Its unique improved OSA module guaranteed the gradient and direction propagation without interference, and maintained channel information while owning deeper network depth, thus improved the network performance. Secondly, BiFPN feature pyramid structure was introduced to connect with the new backbone. BiFPN could not only completed the feature extraction from top to bottom, but also achieved the weighted fusion of features with different resolutions from bottom to top. At the same time, BiFPN increased the horizontal connection between the input and output of the same level, enriching the semantic information of the feature map. Finally, all 3×3 standard convolutions in the model were adjusted by depthwise separable convolution, in order to build a lightweight network. The improved YOLOv4’s network architecture for image target detection consist of three parts. The first part was the new backbone feature extraction network —VoVNetv2-39. It preliminarily extracted the feature of wear particle images in SEM with the input size of 416×416×3. Three initial effective feature layers were obtained by convolution, combination and addition. The second part was the strengthen feature extraction network —SPP and BiFPN. The first feature layer was passed into BiFPN after OSA Module Stage3 and a convolution block. The second feature layer was passed into BiFPN after OSA Module Stage4 and a convolution block. The third feature layer was passed into Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) after OSA module Stage5 and three convolution blocks. SPP used pooling cores with different scales of 13×13, 9×9, 5×5 and 1×1 for maximum pooling and then merged. The merged results were passed into BiFPN which realized feature fusion of the three initial effective feature layers to extract more effective features. The third part was the prediction network-YOLO Head. The feature map was divided into three kinds of grids with different numbers of 52×52, 26×26 and 13×13. The prior frames of different sizes were generated on each grid. The classification, confidence and coordinates of the wear particles in SEM images were predicted by the prior frames, and then the prediction results were output. In the experimental stage, firstly, wear particle images in SEM with typical wear characteristics were selected. The data set was expanded by image data enhancement method. The training set, the validation set and the test set were divided to form the self-built SEM wear particle image set. Secondly, the size of all images was unified as 416×416×3, and then these images were input into the improved YOLOv4’s network. Thirdly, the transfer learning was used to solve the problem of the small number of wear particle images in SEM. The IamgeNet data set was used to pre-train the new model, and the freezing idea was used to accelerate the model training process and obtain the initial weight and deviation of the model. The training parameters were set, and the self-built wear particle image set in SEM was used to start freezing training. In this period, only some parameters of the network were fine-tuned. The unfreezing preparing training began after the freezing training. In this period, the weight and deviation of the model could be updated. Then, the output mAP values were compared to obtain the optimal model. Finally, the actual wear particle images in aeroengine SEM were used to verify. The results showed that, compared with the original YOLOv4 network, the number of the new network’s parameters was significantly reduced and the recognition speed was improved by 51.1% on the premise of ensuring accuracy. It could meet the detection requirements of fast, simple and high precision of actual SEM wear particle images, and had the potential engineering application value. © 2023 Science Press.

However, the diagnosis accuracy has been on a steady decline because of noise interference in industrial applications. In addition, the accuracy improvement is often accompanied by an increase in computational cost, which makes it difficult to achieve engineering-embedded deployment. To find the balance between robustness and complexity, a new intelligent fault diagnosis framework named lightweight multiscale dilated causal convolutional attention network (Li-MDCCAN) is proposed. Based on dual fusion mechanisms, the proposed network realizes high robustness by adopting multiscale strategy and attention modules, which explores multiscale and multidimensional features along three parallel paths. Furthermore, lightweight convolutional blocks are introduced to reduce the network's complexity. The performance of Li-MDCCAN is verified with six different datasets and compared with those of four advanced fault diagnosis networks. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness and superiority of Li-MDCCAN in increasing robustness and decreasing complexity. Moreover, prior sensor placement is discussed to guide applications under limited engineering conditions. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Antinoise; intelligent fault diagnosis; lightweight; multiscale and multidimensional feature extraction; sensor placement","Complex networks; Convolution; Cost engineering; Deep learning; Fault detection; Antinoise; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Lightweight; Multi dimensional; Multi-scale and multi-dimensional feature extraction; Multi-scales; Noisy environment; Sensor placement; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To get the high accuracy for the fault diagnosis, researchers tend to adopt the deep network layers and amount of neurons or kernels in each layer. This results in a large redundancy and the structure uncertainty of the fault diagnosis networks. Moreover, it is hard to deploy these networks on the embedded platforms because of the large scales of the network parameters. This brings huge challenges to the practical application of the intelligent diagnosis algorithms. To solve the above problems, an iterative automatic machine compression method, named Iterative-AMC, is proposed in this paper. The proposed method aims to automatically compress and optimize the structure of the large-scale neural networks. Experiments are carried out based on two test benches.

However, it is worth noting that generating synthetic data using GANs is time-consuming, and synthetic data cannot fully replace real data. To expedite the GAN-based fault diagnostics process, this paper proposes a hybrid lightweight method for compressing GAN parameters. First, three modules are constructed: a teacher generator, a teacher discriminator, and a student generator, based on the knowledge distillation GAN (KD-GAN) approach. The distillation operation is applied to both teacher generator and student generator, while adversarial training is conducted for the teacher generator and the teacher discriminator. Furthermore, a joint loss function is proposed to update the parameters of the student generator by combining distillation loss and adversarial loss. Additionally, the proposed KD-GAN method is combined with deep transfer learning (DTL) and leverages real data to enhance the diagnostic model’s performance. Two numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate that the proposed KD-GAN-DTL method outperforms other GAN-based fault diagnosis methods in terms of computational time and diagnostic accuracy. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deep transfer learning; fault diagnosis; generative adversarial network; knowledge distillation","Deep learning; Distillation; Fault detection; Generative adversarial networks; Learning systems; Numerical methods; Personnel training; Students; Deep transfer learning; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Faults diagnostics; Knowledge distillation; Network-based; Small samples; Synthetic data; Teachers'; Transfer learning; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this paper, we develop an incremental learning-based multi-task shared classifier (IL-MTSC) for bearing fault diagnosis under various conditions. We use a one-dimensional convolutional neural network model as the principal framework. Then, we create a knowledge distillation method that allows the model to retain learned knowledge.

Therefore, this paper proposes a fast and high-precision diagnosis method based on multi-sensing fusion and compression features. First, the traditional random weighting method is optimized. The fluctuations of each signal are calculated, and used as the basis for balancing the weighting relationship between the current and historical sampling values, in order to achieve high precision fusion of bearings signals. Second, based on the traditional compression sensing method, the reconstruction part that would further increase the diagnosis error and time is omitted. The partial Hadamard matrix is constructed to retain the feature trend in the compressed signal, and the bearings fault diagnosis based on the compressed features is realized.

To maximize accuracy, the network architecture of novel models has become complex, and the number of parameters has also increased, which makes them not economical in terms of computational efficiency. Experience has shown that there is irreversible information loss in the process of excessive downsampling. This article proposes the CNN with mixed information (MIXCNN), a classification model that is efficient and lightweight for end-to-end fault diagnosis, and the convolutional layers maintain the same size of the output throughout the network. The MIXCNN uses depthwise convolution to increase the ability of discrimination in spatial locations and uses traditional convolution to achieve cross-channel interaction of information; then, the residual connection is introduced to reduce the loss of information on the convolutional layers. By appropriately increasing the depth of the network, MIXCNN pays more attention to features that are differentiated and highly recognizable, and more spatial information is mixed by a larger convolution kernel inside the MIXCNN. Experimental validation using publicly available datasets reveals that the proposed method has higher accuracy and generalization capability than state-of-the-art fault diagnosis methods. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); end-to-end; fault diagnosis; mixed information; rotating machinery","Classification (of information); Computational efficiency; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Fault detection; Network architecture; Neural networks; Rotating machinery; Classification models; Convolutional neural network; Down sampling; End to end; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Information loss; Machinery fault diagnosis; Mixed information; Spatial location; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To address this issue, we propose a lightweight fault diagnosis model based on knowledge distillation. The model employs complex residual networks with high classification accuracy as teachers and simple combinatorial convolutional networks as students. The student model has a similar structure to the teacher model, with fewer layers, and uses pixel-wise convolution and channel-wise convolution instead of the original convolution. Students learn the probability distribution rule of the output layer of teacher models to enhance their fault classification accuracy and achieve model compression.

Fault diagnosis is the guarantee of its safe operation. But its vibration signal contains a lot of noise and is not stable. Existing intelligent algorithms are difficult to extract fault features of it. Methods: To solve this problem, a speed-adaptive graph convolutional network (SAGCN) for fault diagnosis of the wheelset-bearing system is proposed. The model can fuse three types of information. First, the deep convolutional layer is used to extract the features of vibration signals and speed signals to improve speed adaptability. Then, feature compression and connection are carried out by global average pooling (GAP). The graph construction layer (GCL) is proposed to extract the spatial topology. Finally, the obtained three types of fault information are input into GCN for data fusion and fault classification to improve the noise robustness of the model. Results: The time-varying rotation speed samples are obtained from the test rig. Compared with the five methods, the proposed model can achieve the highest diagnostic accuracy, with an average accuracy of 98.83%. Two sample sets with different SNRs are constructed for experiments, and the average accuracy of the proposed model can still reach 97.54% and 96.21%. Conclusion: The experimental results show that the proposed SAGCN has good speed adaptability and noise robustness. So this study can be beneficial to the fault diagnosis of wheelset-bearing systems under time-varying speed conditions. © 2023, Krishtel eMaging Solutions Private Limited.","Data fusion; Graph convolution network; Speed adaptive ability; Wheel-set bearing fault diagnosis","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

For this reason, memories occupy a significant part of Automotive SoC's die area, increasing the defect probability inside the embedded storage. Automotive SoC manufacturers need to deeply test their embedded memories as they are one of the significant contributors to the yield of their devices. The test effort increases for the characterization of new technologies and new families of devices that need to be characterized by the manufacturers. These tests generate a massive quantity of diagnostic information that is incredibly valuable for designers and technology experts. This diagnostic information can be analyzed to identify and correct possible weaknesses and misbehavior. The easiest way to collect memory diagnostic information consists of failure bitmaps in which each fault is saved as coordinates. This method is the simplest solution to implement. However, logging the coordinates of every fault may generate an unmanageable quantity of data. This problem is exacerbated when there is an on-chip limitation on the amount of data that can be saved or transmitted to the external world.This paper presents an optimized on-chip compression algorithm that allows to reduce the required on-chip memory to store diagnostic information during embedded memory testing. This solution allows the reconstruction of a failure bitmap, generating a topological representation of the density of the failings bits in the embedded on-chip memory. The proposed approach effectively reduces the used storage to a fraction with respect to the one used by the original failing bitmap. The algorithm uses a coordinates-based approach, in which the memory is logically divided into equally divided sectors. The small time overhead introduced by the algorithm is compensated by the ability to achieve optimal space utilization.  © 2023 IEEE.","Automotive SoC; compression; memory diagnosis; reliability","Automotive industry; Data compression; Digital storage; Embedded systems; Memory architecture; Programmable logic controllers; Automotive system-on-chip; Automotive Systems; Bit maps; Compression; Diagnostics informations; Embedded memory; Memory diagnosis; On chips; On-chip-memory; Systems-on-Chip; System-on-chip","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Nevertheless, the data scarcity of compound fault samples jeopardizes the modeling performance of deep learning algorithms. Meta-learning has become an effective tool in few-shot fault diagnosis modeling. However, due to the training instability of meta-learning, it is challenging to deploy advanced networks such as transformers as the base learner due to the extremely large model size. Therefore, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional transformers (LCT) network enhanced meta-learning (Meta-LCT) method to achieve accurate compound fault diagnosis with limited compound fault samples. Specifically, the LCT is first designed by taking the advantage of linear spatial reduction (LSR) attention and spatial pooling mechanism to achieve high computational efficiency. LCT is adopted as the base learner in the Meta-stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, and then, the meta-training is performed based on the single fault data. Subsequently, the limited compound fault samples are used in the meta testing stage to obtain a compound fault diagnosis model. An experimental study based on the real-world compound fault dataset of industrial robots is presented. The experimental results indicate that the proposed Meta-LCT can achieve the compound fault diagnosis accuracy of 81.1% when only 40 data samples in each compound fault category are available.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Compound fault diagnosis; deep learning; industrial robot; meta-learning; transformers networks","Computational efficiency; Convolution; Deep learning; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Industrial robots; Job analysis; Learning algorithms; Compound; Compound fault diagnosis; Compound faults; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Metalearning; Task analysis; Transformer; Transformer network; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Thus, for on-site fault diagnosis implemented on edge computing platform, efficient multisource data fusion and low-cost computation is essential for fault diagnosis. In this study, a fault diagnosis scheme based on multisource sensor data com-pression is proposed, and its advantages include high data compression & fusion efficiency, low computational cost, and fast online training. The method includes reference matrix construction, compression and fusion, sparse vectors calculation, testing sample reconstruction & quality evaluation. First, a reference matrix is constructed with labelled multisource sensor data. Then, the reference matrix is compressed using a measurement matrix, meanwhile, the multisource data samples are fused. Later, the testing sample is sparsely represented based on batch matching pursuit algorithm, and outputs a sparse vector. Finally, based on reconstruction quality evaluation, the pattern of the testing sample is determined. Two cases are employed to validate the effective-ness of the proposed approach, including landfill gas power generator maintenance pattern recognition and multiple redundancy aileron actuator fault diagnosis, and the accuracy is 96.13% and 97.50%, respectively. © 2023, Cefin Publishing House.

In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient&#x2019;s data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoTs), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This paper proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.

Here, we consider three applicable 4-bit S-boxes, which are used in lightweight block ciphers PRESENT and PRINCE and lightweight hash function SPONGENT as basic circuits for the error-correcting method. The proposed design does not require two-rail checkers for detecting the error and the redundant S-box for repairing the S-box. This reduces the overall area consumption of the proposed design. In the proposed approach, the error-correcting part of the circuit is implemented concurrently with the main circuit of the S-box. Therefore, the four output bits of the S-box are tested individually to improve the efficiency of fault diagnosis. The proposed fault-tolerant S-box method can detect and repair transient and permanent faults simultaneously. In other words, the structure can detect and repair single, double, triple, and quadruple faults at a time. The comparison with the famous fault-tolerant and error-correcting methods shows that the ability of the proposed method to create error-correcting 4-bit S-boxes is acceptable. The performance of S-boxes with error and with our error-correcting method has been investigated in the image encryption. The analyzes show that the proposed method has the desirable results.

To address the problem of the unbalanced distribution of LRE sample categories, an empirical knowledge reconstruction expression model is proposed. Instead of the traditional sample-label one-to-one training model, the model represents the operational status of the input samples by measuring the similarity between the input samples and each sample in the historical knowledge base, combined with the expert knowledge in the historical experience base. The model combines the powerful data mining capability of the neural network model with the precise point analysis capability of the expert knowledge, while the continuously improved historical sample distribution and expert knowledge and experience base provide the scientific basis for the state discrimination and improvement direction of LRE. Further, the validity and engineering value of the proposed method was verified using real LRE test drive data. © 2023 IEEE.","Knowledge representation; Liquid rocket engine; Operational state identification; Similarity measures","Data mining; Digital storage; Neural network models; Rocket engines; Rockets; Empirical knowledge; Experience Base; Expert knowledge; Input sample; Knowledge-representation; Liquid rocket engines; Operational state; Operational state identification; Similarity measure; State identification; Knowledge representation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The high sampling frequency of data collection preserves fault characteristics but brings the problem of big data. An effective way to reduce this problem is to apply data compression. However, in order not to affect the diagnostic performance of data, it is difficult to improve the compression ratio further. Inspired by the binarization method, the compression dimension of the bit cost of a single sample point is first introduced into the fault-mechanism-based method in this article. On this basis, a three-dimensional data compression method is proposed, and it is subsequently validated with two real-bearing datasets. Two performance metrics, including a newly defined one, are utilized to compare the proposed method with the five existing methods.

Power equipment infrared diagnosis can timely and accurately diagnose the potential accidents and fault precursors of operating power equipment, which is an important part of power inspection.

Therefore, how to quickly and accurately diagnose the health condition of the train running gear bearings under strong noise and variable working conditions has become one of the core contents of the intelligent operation and maintenance strategy. To meet these requirements, a lightweight convolutional neural network based on multiscale attentional feature fusion (MA-LCNN) is proposed in this paper, which takes the inverted residual network as the main structure. Firstly, a multiscale attention module (MA) was designed to extract fault feature information. Secondly, by embedding MAs in different locations, the ability of the MA-LCNN to extract fault feature information is greatly improved. Finally, an ablation experiment and noise resistance experiment are performed. The recognition accuracy scores of the MA-LCNN for cases 2 and 3 are 99.70% and 99.83%, respectively. The results show that the proposed attention module has better learning ability and stability compared to the contrast modules.

However, the above works broadly suffer from the following three shortcomings. (1) Most of the networks are complex in structure and not lightweight enough, introducing a large number of computations and parameters. (2) Batch normalization is used in the most lightweight networks, which causes the networks to perform poorly after training with a small batch size. (3) The input length of the above CNN-based network is fixed, which reduces the generalization performance of the network in different application scenarios. Therefore, a lightweight network with adaptive input and adaptive channel pruning strategy is proposed in this study to solve these shortcomings. First, a lightweight network is designed to enable the network to be trained with small batch size. Second, the proposed adaptive input module enables the network automatically adjusts the input length for guaranteeing the generalization ability without tuning network parameters. Lastly, an adaptive channel pruning strategy is proposed to further reduce the network parameters and computational workload. The superior performance of the proposed network is validated and confirmed on three bearing datasets accompanied by comparative analysis with typical networks.

Because of the lack of labels, unsupervised learning is commonly used in fault diagnosis model. However, unsupervised learning method requires too much computing power and storage, so it’s hard to be deployed to airborne computing platform with limited computing power and storage.

In our method, we trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to imitate the unsupervised model, and use Simulated Annealing (SA) method to find the difference between them.

Due to sensor errors or communication failures, raw building data with missing data points are rarely satisfactory for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) applications. In this paper, a new framework named a deep variational mixture of principal component analyzers (DV-MPPCA) is proposed to address the building FDD problem with incomplete data. DV-MPPCA is the combination of a variational autoencoder (VAE) model for data compression and a mixture of principal component analyzers (MPPCA) for density estimation. To construct an integrated framework comprising both VAE and MPPCA, we introduce a novel methodology that represents the algebraic model of MPPCA within the architecture of a neural network. This innovative architecture undergoes optimization through the minimization of a designated loss function. Subsequently, the refined and optimized framework is harnessed as an unsupervised fault detection model for a real-world air handling unit (AHU) system designed by the ASHRAE research project 1312 (RP-1312). Furthermore, by incorporating the modified evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss function within the VAE, the resulting DV-MPPCA framework exhibits exceptional performance when confronted with incomplete AHU datasets, even with high missing rates. Empirical findings substantiate the supremacy of DV-MPPCA over other contemporary classic and deep models. Impressively, even with a missing rate as modest as 10%, DV-MPPCA consistently delivers outstanding performance, achieving F1-scores of 98.10%, 93.50%, and 81.57% for the Summer, Winter, and Spring datasets, respectively. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;This article was motivated by the fact that raw building data with missing data points are not qualitative enough for direct use in fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) applications. To resolve this problem, existing studies manipulated imputation algorithms in the preprocessing step to prepare the data for constructing FDD models and impute missing points in test instances during the online monitoring process. However, this step makes an overall FDD framework cumbersome. Therefore, instead of utilizing a data imputation method as a separately operating model, we adopt VAE in our framework to exclude the contribution of missing points during the offline modeling and online monitoring processes. This modification of VAE helps our framework be immune to incomplete data.

It is necessary to identify damage of solar panels in a timely manner, as solar panels are important components in photovoltaic power generation. In this paper, a lightweight solar panel fault diagnosis system based on image pre-processing and an improved VGG-19 network is proposed to address the problem of blurred solar panel field images, which are not easy for defects detection. First, we use Daubechies 4(DB4) wavelet and morphology-based enhancements to improve the quality of solar panel images. Then, conventional convolutional layers in the VGG-19 are replaced with separable convolutional layers to reduce the number of network parameters and improve training efficiency. Finally, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is introduced to improve the accuracy of solar panel defects’ detection. A dataset consisting of 3344 images of solar panels was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in defect detection.

The blending of virtual and real between physical entity and digital twin was realized, and the effectiveness and accuracy of bogie’s fault diagnosis and health management were improved. The digital twin of bogie was a data-driven virtual model with multi-disciplinary, multi physics, multi-scale and high fidelity. The input of the model was multi-source data such as its own structural parameters, on-board online monitoring data and regular maintenance data. The output was performance evaluation indexes (such as derailment coefficient, wheel load reduction rate) and structural strength indexes (such as stress and cumulative damage) displayed in real time. It can reflect and predict the dynamics and strength performance of the bogie in the whole life cycle, so as to innovate the existing bogie operation and maintenance mode. A frame structure of bogie digital twin construction was proposed, which can realize the real-time dynamic display and feedback design of key technical indexes of dynamics and structural strength. The four key technologies and technical routes of bogie twin modeling were described. The simulation methods and detailed steps of bogie dynamics twin model and structural strength twin model were given. Some simulation test design schemes were compared and analyzed and an optimal proposal scheme was proposed. A technical route of agent model based on deep learning neural network was proposed, and the effectiveness and accuracy of the model were verified by the cases of wheel rail force prediction and wheel-set stress prediction. The results of this study can be used to guide the development of the core module of digital twin engineering application of bogie and deploy it on the ground center. © 2023, Central South University Press.

With the deep-learning (DL) method applied, the current-based methods have achieved satisfactory diagnosis accuracy. DL methods, however, demand large quantities of training samples, which are difficult to implement in real industrial sites. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel lightweight fault diagnosis method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), called CombFilterNet (CF-Net). The first convolutional layer of CF-Net is called comb filter layer (CF-layer), where the convolution kernel is the comb filter kernel (CF-kernel). Each CF-kernel only has three parameters to be updated, achieving a lightweight design that makes CF-Net suitable for limited training sample conditions. The effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method are validated by a laboratory-acquired current dataset and an open-source vibration dataset. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the comparative methods under limited training sample conditions. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Comb filter kernel (CF-kernel); convolutional neural network (CNN); fault diagnosis; limited training sample; motor current signal analysis","Bandpass filters; Comb filters; Convolution; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Neural networks; Sampling; Vibration analysis; Comb filter kernel; Comb-filter; Convolutional neural network; Current signal analysis; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Kernel; Limited training sample; Motor current signal analyse; Motor current signals; Training sample; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Machine learning (ML) methods are commonly utilized for data analytics in such systems. Cyberattacks are a grave threat to I-IoT as they can manipu-late legitimate inputs, corrupting ML predictions and causing disruptions in the production systems. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is a brain-inspired ML method that has been shown to be sufficiently accurate while being extremely robust, fast, and energy-efficient. In this work, we use non-linear encoding-based HD for intelligent fault diagnosis against different adversarial attacks. Our black-box adversarial attacks first train a substitute model and create perturbed test instances using this trained model. These examples are then transferred to the target models. The change in the classification accuracy is measured as the difference before and after the attacks. This change measures the resiliency of a learning method. Our experiments show that HD leads to a more resilient and lightweight learning solution than the state-of-the-art deep learning methods. HD has up to 67.5% higher resiliency compared to the state-of-the-art methods while being up to 25.1× faster to train. © 2023 EDAA.","","Data Analytics; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Automated production systems; Brain-inspired; Cyber-attacks; Data analytics; Energy efficient; Fully automated; Learning methods; Machine learning methods; Machine-learning; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

For this purpose, plenty of methods are recently proposed to adapt a machine learning model to a target domain without any labeled data from the target domain or access to the source domain's data distribution, which is called source-free domain adaptation (SFDA). However, existing methods generally focus on SFDA with a single-source domain and the fault categories are often inconsistent between different working conditions. A natural idea is to derive the fault knowledge of different fault categories from multiple source domains. Therefore, a knowledge distillation based multiple SFDA framework (KD-MSFDA) is proposed in this study. To be specific, multiple source predictors are pretrained locally and transferred to the target domain. A KD with predictor confidence vote process is designed to filter the invalid source domains, which can extremely help extract more reliable unitive expert knowledge. Meanwhile, a knowledge contribution (KC)-based domain weight adaptation strategy is proposed to automatically assign the weight of each source domain. Extensive experiments on an automobile transmission (AT) dataset and a bearing dataset are designed to demonstrate the proposed framework. And the experimental performance verifies that the proposed framework is effective for multiple SFDA scenarios.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; knowledge distillation; multiple source-free domain adaptation (SFDA); rotating machinery","Data privacy; Distillation; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Adaptation models; Domain adaptation; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Knowledge distillation; Multiple source; Multiple source-free domain adaptation; Network-based; Target domain; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This paper represents a fault diagnosis scheme based on two-stage compressed sensing for triaxial vibration data, which realizes fault diagnosis for rotating machinery based on compressed data and data reconstruction for professional vibration analysis. In the 1st stage, the triaxial vibration signals are compressed using a pre-designed hybrid measurement matrix; these compressed data can be used both for time-frequency transform and for vibration data reconstruction. In the 2nd stage, the frequency spectra of the triaxial vibration signals are fused and further compressed using another pre-designed joint measurement matrix, which inhibits the high-frequency noises simultaneously. Finally, the fused spectra are employed as feature vectors in sparse-representation-based classification, where the proposed batch matching pursuit (BMP) algorithm is utilized to calculate the sparse vectors. The two-stage compression scheme and the BMP algorithm minimize the computational cost of on-site fault diagnosis, which is suitable for edge computing platforms. Meanwhile, the compressed vibration data can be reconstructed, which provides evidence for professional vibration analysis. The method proposed in this study is validated by two practical case studies, in which the accuracies are 99.73% and 96.70%, respectively. © 2023 by the authors.","compressed sensing; data fusion; fault diagnosis; sparse representation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the excessive depth of these models often hinders their deployment on Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In order to facilitate the implementation of graph-based models on IoT devices for fault diagnosis of HSR bogie, this paper proposes a novel compression technique called GraKD. GraKD distills the latent knowledge from the teacher model to a lightweight student model in an adversarial manner. The discriminator of GraKD comprises a representation identifier and a logit identifier. The former effectively distinguishes between the node representations of the student and the teacher by discerning the local affinity of connected node patch-patch pairs and the global affinity represented by the patch-global pairs. The latter employs a residual multi-layer perceptron block to differentiate between the logits of the student and the teacher. The effectiveness of GraKD is validated using data collected from test rigs of bogies. A series of experiments substantiate the broad applicability of GraKD in compressing various GNN-based models.

However, the uneven grayscale of the infrared images, multiple target regions, and large radiation noise pose challenges to achieving accurate segmentation and efficient data extraction for the interested regions. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm based on the Deeplabv3+ network, using the lightweight MobileNetV2 as a replacement for the original Xception backbone network to improve computational efficiency and reduce overfitting. We also employ a composite loss function and cosine annealing learning rate to balance foreground-background segmentation and avoid local optima. Furthermore, we integrate the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to extract and combine important spatial and channel features, allowing the algorithm to focus on identifying elements of the circuit board instead of background pixels, thereby improving segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency on our self-built infrared circuit board dataset, with a MIoU of 90.34%, MPA of 95.26%, and processing speed of 25.19 fps.

Nevertheless, most existing diagnosis methodologies are developed based on the assumption that machinery operates under stable conditions, which may limit their ability to uncover sufficient discriminative features when confronted with high noise levels. To tackle this issue, this article proposes a joint threshold learning convolutional network (JT-LCN) for rotating machinery diagnosis under nonstationary conditions. The major contributions of this research work can be summarized and highlighted as follows: 1) proposing a novel plug-and-play joint-thresholding module (JTM) that uses both soft and hard threshold mechanisms for intelligent signal denoising; 2) constructing an end-to-end network architecture, termed JT-LCN, which achieves a lightweight design through the use of depthwise separable convolution (DSC) and effectively purifies and identifies discriminative fault-related information by progressively using the JTM; and 3) introducing a dynamic self-knowledge distillation approach to enhance the generalization ability of the proposed network while minimizing computational costs and run-time memory requirements. Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate that the developed JT-LCN outperforms competition state-of-the-art approaches. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Dynamic self-knowledge distillation approach; fault diagnosis; joint threshold learning convolutional network (JT-LCN); joint-thresholding module (JTM); nonstationary conditions; rotating machinery","Convolution; Distillation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Memory architecture; Neural networks; Rotating machinery; Convolutional networks; Convolutional neural network; Dynamic self-knowledge distillation approach (DDLB); Faults diagnosis; Information filter; Joint threshold learning convolutional network; Joint-thresholding module; Non-stationary condition; Threshold learning; Thresholding; Network architecture","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Some unexpected and new fault types will inevitably appear in actual conditions, which are called incremental fault types or class increments. Traditional DL models require the costly collection of all known data for retraining; while the use of new fault data may lead to catastrophic forgetting of old tasks. To solve the problem of bearing diagnosis with incremental fault types, a lifelong learning method based on generative feature replay (LLMGFR) is proposed in this study. A feature distillation method is put forward in this method to avoid forgetting in the feature extractor. The generator is trained to produce old task features. The generated features are mixed with real features of the current task to solve the imbalance problem and catastrophic forgetting of the classifier effectively. According to incremental fault diagnosis cases, LLMGFR can learn constantly and adaptively in dynamic environments with incremental fault types. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Catastrophic forgetting; class increment; fault diagnosis; lifelong learning","Deep learning; Distillation; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Generative adversarial networks; Job analysis; Catastrophic forgetting; Class increment; Fault types; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Generator; Learning methods; Life long learning; Task analysis; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Timely bearing fault diagnosis can prevent equipment failure and costly downtime. In recent years, developing machine learning based bearing fault diagnosis with few labelled data has attracted a lot of attention as datasets with fault labels are rare in many industrial applications. One effective approach to meet the challenge is few-shot learning. Among many approaches, utilizing a good pre-trained deep learning model to achieve few-shot learning is an effective and efficient alternative. In this paper, a pre-trained deep learning model called CLIP that combines image processing and natural language processing (NLP) is adopted to few-shot learning for plastic bearing fault diagnosis. We explore the feasibility of leveraging CLIP model in the realm of bearing fault diagnosis via few-shot learning. Specifically, we tackle the challenges posed by CLIP's creation of requisite text prompt embeddings for the diagnosis of mechanical faults, within a few-shot learning framework. Our investigation illuminates the remarkable capability of CLIP to adapt to new tasks with minimal examples, a feature we exploit to devise a solution for plastic bearing fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the few-shot learning method with CLIP is demonstrated using vibration data collected from plastic bearing seeded fault tests in the laboratory. © 2023 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

The existing fault diagnosis methods have the characteristics of heavy computing and storage load, and most of them have computational redundancy, which is not suitable for deployment on edge devices with limited resources and capabilities. This paper proposes a novel two-stage edge-side fault diagnosis method based on double knowledge distillation. First, we offer a clustering-based self-knowledge distillation approach (Cluster KD), which takes the mean value of the sample diagnosis results, clusters them, and takes the clustering results as the terms of the loss function. It utilizes the correlations between faults of the same type to improve the accuracy of the teacher model, especially for fault categories with high similarity. Then, the double knowledge distillation framework uses ordinary knowledge distillation to build a lightweight model for edge-side deployment. We propose a two-stage edge-side fault diagnosis method (TSM) that separates fault detection and fault diagnosis into different stages: in the first stage, a fault detection model based on a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) is adopted to achieve fast fault responses; in the second stage, a diverse convolution model with variance weighting (DCMVW) is used to diagnose faults in detail, extracting features from micro and macro perspectives. Through comparison experiments conducted on two fault datasets, it is proven that the proposed method has high accuracy, low delays, and small computation, which is suitable for intelligent edge-side fault diagnosis. In addition, experiments show that our approach has a smooth training process and good balance. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

When generating the Petri net reachability graph necessary for constructing a reachability diagnoser, one may face the state explosion problem. As a Petri net gets more complicated, the complexity of its reachability graph also increases exponentially.

Most of state-of-the-art research methods in the field of gear fault diagnosis combining the deep learning methods with multi-sensor data fusion, big data analysis, and physical models to achieve more accurate fault diagnosis techniques. However, there are still some shortcomings in the method of gear fault diagnosis based on deep network model. First, the impact of noise on model diagnostics is rarely considered, and second, there is a conflict between the large number of parameters and calculations of deep networks and the computing resources of current embedded platforms. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multilayer fusion convolutional neural network (AMFCNN) and a multilayer fusion module-relational knowledge distillation (MFM-RKD) module based on attention mechanism. The multilayer fusion network utilizes Inception module to extract multi-scale features from multi-sensor information, and adopts attention mechanism to extract features from the network in different periods. The MFM-RKD module activates the extracted features of different periods through fully connected layer, and transfers structural knowledge to lightweight student network through relational knowledge distillation to build a lightweight multi-sensor gear fault diagnosis model. Experiments show that the lightweight model has excellent robustness in different noise environments. Compared with the teacher network, the model performance is reduced by less than 2% while the calculations the model is reduced by 92 times and the running memory is reduced by 7.74 times, which provides an efficient solution to address the robustness and model deployment issues in gear fault diagnosis.

According to the design feature of its series controller, the signals on key nodes, which can be directly measured, can be used as the data source for fault diagnosis. In this paper, a deep learning technique of residual 1-D CNN equipped with parallel structure is proposed for fault recognition and classification in a dynamic process. With the help of wavelet transform and probabilistic heat map, it is found that the phase current fault feature is distinct in the frequency domain. In contrast, the uniform demagnetization fault and pressure recession fault are more obvious in the time domain. Therefore, the parallel network structure with a wide and narrow convolutional kernel is used, which can handle multiple complex fault features simultaneously. Simulation models based on both data-driven and mathematical formulations are also established to better fit the actual nonlinear conditions. Finally, the proposed network structure can reach 92.1% classification accuracy compared with the commonly used lightweight 2-D CNN model. It can be concluded that 1-D CNN achieves similar classification results as 2-D CNN with less computational resource consumption. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Deep learning; Fault detection; Frequency domain analysis; Hydraulic equipment; Brake-by-wire systems; Data-driven approach; Design features; Fault feature; Fault model; Faults diagnosis; Hydraulic system; Network structures; Pressure source; Signal-on; Wavelet transforms","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Recently, various researches have been developed to pursue fast and energy-efficient deep learning accelerators. However, devices may suffer from hard defects and hardware variability during its lifetime, which poses severe challenges to deep learning accelerators. To protect edge deep learning accelerators from fault-induced failures, we leverage the adversarial deep learning technique to tailor a lightweight online fault detection method for neural network accelerator chips. The proposed Adversarial Testing scheme (AT) is a function-level testing method outcompeting conventional test in several ways: negligible run-time overhead, super sensitivity to subtle hardware variations, which reduces chip over-kills and also the unnecessary diagnosis operations. The evaluation results show that AT can accurately detect fault occurrence and ensure the normal use of deep learning accelerator during its lifetime.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Deep neural networks; E-learning; Energy efficiency; Learning systems; Sensitivity analysis; Complex task; Detection methods; Energy efficient; Learning techniques; Neural-networks; On-line fault detection; On-line testing; Performance; Testing method; Testing schemes; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Only by accurately detecting insulator damage can potential safety hazards and equipment damage due to damaged insulators be avoided in time. Aiming at the problems of low accuracy and large model computation of existing insulator and defect detection algorithms, this paper proposes the insulator and defect detection model YOLO-S (YOLO-Small). First, the PAN structure in Neck uses lightweight convolutional GSConv instead of the standard convolutional Conv, introduces GSbottleneck on the basis of GSConv, and uses the method of OSA to design the cross-level partial network GSCSP module (VoV-GSCSP). The use of VoV-GSCSP instead of the C3 module in Neck reduces the computational effort and maintains the accuracy. Secondly, a new attention module, MaECA (MainECA), is designed based on the ECA attention mechanism to enhance target perception. After that, the SILU function in the SPPF in YOLOv5s is replaced with the Mish function, HardSwish function, and ReLU function, respectively, and the results show that the replacement of the Mish function (MishSPPF) is more effective in preventing the distortion of the image caused by image cropping and scaling, and thus improving the accuracy. Finally, the SIoU loss function is used to replace the original loss function CIoU, which improves the number of transmitted frames per second and the detection accuracy of the pictures. The mAP of YOLO-S is 4.2% higher than that of YOLOv5s, the detection accuracy is improved by 2.1%, and the model parameter computation is reduced by 6.0%, which still gives YOLO-S a higher recognition accuracy when compared with existing detection algorithms under the same conditions.  © 2013 IEEE.","activation function; attentional mechanisms; GSConv; insulator defect detection; SIoU; YOLOv5s","Damage detection; Defects; Fault detection; Image enhancement; Signal detection; Activation functions; Attentional mechanism; Attenuation measurements; Computational modelling; Defect detection; Faults diagnosis; Gsconv; Insulator; Insulator defect detection; Neck; Shape; SIoU; YOLOv5; Convolution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We provide a fault anomaly detection technique based on distillation learning to address this issue. Two Vision Transformer (ViT) models are specifically used in the distillation learning process, one of which serves as the teacher network and the other as the student network. By using a small-scale student network model, the computational efficiency of the model is increased without sacrificing model accuracy. For feature-centered representation, new loss and anomaly score functions are created, and an enhanced Transformer encoder with the residual block is proposed. Then, a rolling bearing dynamics simulation method is used to obtain rich fault sample data, and the pre-training of the teacher network is completed. For anomaly detection, the training of the student network is completed based on the proposed loss function and the pre-trained teacher network, using only the vibration acceleration samples obtained from the normal state. Finally, the trained completed network and the designed anomaly score function are used to achieve the anomaly detection of rolling bearing faults. The experimental validation was carried out on two sets of test data and one set of real vibration data of a whole aero-engine, and the detection accuracy reached 100 %. The results show that the proposed method has a high capability of rolling bearing fault anomaly detection. © 2023 ISA","Aero-engine; Anomaly detection; Distillation learning; Rolling bearings; Vision transformer","Aircraft engines; Computational efficiency; Distillation; Engines; Fault detection; Learning systems; Personnel training; Roller bearings; Students; Aero-engine; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Bearing fault; Distillation learning; Rolling bearings; Score function; Student network; Teachers'; Vision transformer; Anomaly detection","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Such mechanical malfunctions may disrupt factory output, resulting in financial losses or human casualties. Therefore, we investigate a deep learning model that can detect abnormalities in machines based on the operating noise. Various data preprocessing methods, including the discrete wavelet transform, the Hilbert transform, and short-time Fourier transform, were applied to extract characteristics from machine-operating noises. To create a model that can be used in factories, the environment of real factories was simulated by introducing noise and quality degradation to the sound dataset for Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII). Thus, we proposed a lightweight model that runs reliably even in noisy and low-quality sound data environments, such as a real factory. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short-Term Memory (CNN–LSTM) model using Short-Time Fourier Transforms (STFTs), and the proposed model can be very effective in terms of application because it is a lightweight model that requires only about 6.6% of the number of parameters used in the underlying CNN, and has only a performance difference within 0.5%. © 2023 by the authors.","CNN; deep learning; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; image representation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, two drawbacks induced by its intrinsic architecture limit its application, especially in fault diagnosis. First, the quadratic complexity of its self-attention scheme extremely increases the computation cost, which poses a challenge to apply Transformer to a computationally limited platform like an industry system. In addition, the sequence-based modeling in the Transformer increases the training difficulty and requires a large-scale training dataset. This drawback becomes serious when Transformer is applied in fault diagnosis where only limited data is available. To mitigate these issues, we rethink this common approach and propose a new Transformer, which is more suitable for fault diagnosis. In this article, we first show that the attention module can be actually replaced with or even surpassed by a convolution layer under some conditions in mathematics and experiments. Then, we adopt the convolutions into the Transformer, where the computation burden issue is alleviated and the fault classification accuracy is significantly improved. Furthermore, to increase the computation efficiency, a lightweight Transformer called LiteFormer, is developed by utilizing the depth-wise convolutional layer. Extensive experiments are carried out on four datasets: Case Western Reserve University dataset; Paderborn University dataset; and two gearbox datasets of drivetrain dynamic simulator. Through our experiments, our LiteFormer not only reduces the computation cost in model training, but also sets new state-of-the-art results, surpassing other counterparts in both fault classification accuracy and model robustness.

However, the lack of evaluation criteria results in limited interpretability of domain-invariant features. Additionally, current pseudo-label prediction methods heavily rely on label information or computational resources, and the traditional Softmax function fails to capture valuable information. To address these problems, this article proposes a UDA method based on domain-invariant features evaluation and knowledge distillation (KD) for bearing fault diagnosis. First, mutual information and soft attention mechanism are integrated into the extraction of multivariate features to access the quality of domain-invariant features and enhance interpretability. Then, the concept of KD is introduced to predict pseudo-labels in the target domain without relying on label information or computational resources. Furthermore, an asynchronous feature metric adaptive strategy is developed to adjust the feature alignment metric, considering the maturity and precision of pseudo-labels. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through comparative experiments and ablation studies on two bearing datasets. © 2023 IEEE.","Domain-invariant features; fault diagnosis; knowledge distillation (KD); pseudo-labels; soft attention mechanism (SAM)","Data mining; Distillation; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Job analysis; Attention mechanisms; Domain-invariant feature; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Invariant features; Kernel; Knowledge distillation; Mutual informations; Pseudo-label; Soft attention mechanism; Task analysis; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Recent boosting deep learning technology has been widely used for fault diagnosis (FD) and obtained great success. However, most of them require collecting sufficient data to train the model while it is difficult and even not available sometimes due to the system faults’ variability and randomness. To overcome this issue, this article presents a novel and effective deep model named dual-level multi-scale convolution neural network (DL-MSCNN) for FD with limited training samples. Primarily, it utilizes dual-level multi-scale schemes to extract rich hidden features from raw signals for accurate FD. Firstly, the raw signals are preprocessed by differ-scale average window functions to obtain its grain-level scale representation. Secondly, each grain-level scale feature is fed into a multi-scale cascade CNN (implemented with different kernels) to mine its deeper and detail-level scale representation. Various detail-level scale representations are fused as the fusion features of each grain-level scale CNN (GL-SCNN) representation. Besides, one multi-task supervised scheme (MTSS) is developed to supervise each detail-level scale CNN (DL-SCNN) to learn thoroughly. Finally, the comprehensive features are integrated from all detail-level representations for FD. The authors designed, trained, and tested the proposed method on three real data sets. The comparative analysis confirmed the proposed method’s effectiveness with scarce training samples. In addition, we also proved that the MTSS has a good generality for FD on other multi-scale structures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Convolution neural network (CNN); Fault diagnosis; Multi-level multi-scale; Time series classification","Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Cost reduction; Deep learning; Fault detection; Finite difference method; Sampling; Convolution neural network; Faults diagnosis; Multi tasks; Multi-level multi-scale; Multi-scales; Multilevels; Raw signals; Time series classifications; Training sample; Failure analysis","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

They are, typically, empirically handcrafted by experts, a process that is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The configurable resource capacity for the edge hardware is not considered in manual lightweight models; therefore, they may not meet deployment requirements. Here, a method based on a hardware-resource-constrained neural architecture search is proposed. Fault-diagnosis models are automatically designed for edge hardware considering the hardware configurable resource capacity. First, an empirically inspired search space is designed to reduce the search difficulty in lightweight models. Subsequently, a hardware-resource-constrained reward function is modeled to guide an agent in considering the hardware configurable resource capacity during the search and for iteratively sampling lightweight diagnostic models meeting the deployment requirements. Finally, Pareto-optimal domination is used to obtain a competitive Pareto-optimal solution set, providing an optimal model for the edge hardware to achieve fault diagnosis of wind-turbine gearboxes.

They are vulnerable to various faults due to long-term and heavy-duty operating conditions. To improve the safety and reliability of helical gearboxes, it is necessary to monitor their health conditions and diagnose various types of faults. The conventional measurements for gearbox fault diagnosis mainly include lubricant analysis, vibration, airborne acoustics, thermal images, electrical signals, etc. However, a single domain measurement may lead to unreliable fault diagnosis and the contact installation of transducers is not always accessible, especially in harsh and dangerous environments. In this article, a Compressive Sensing (CS)-based Dual-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method was proposed to accurately and intelligently diagnose common gearbox faults based on two complementary non-contact measurements (thermal images and acoustic signals) from a mobile phone. The raw acoustic signals were analysed by the Modulation Signal Bispectrum (MSB) to highlight the coupled modulation components relating to gear faults and suppress the irrelevant components and random noise, which generates a series of two-dimensional matrices as sparse MSB magnitude images. Then, CS was used to reduce the image redundancy but retain key information owing to the high sparsity of thermal images and acoustic MSB images, which significantly accelerates the CNN training speed. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed CS-based Dual-Channel CNN method significantly improves the diagnostic accuracy (99.39% on average) of industrial helical gearbox faults compared to the single-channel ones. © 2022 The Author(s)","Compressive sensing; Dual-channel CNN; Gearbox fault diagnosis; Modulation signal bispectrum; Non-contact measurements","Acoustics; Cell Phone; Data Compression; Electricity; Reproducibility of Results; Acoustic waves; Compressed sensing; Condition monitoring; Fault detection; Image analysis; Modulation; Vibration analysis; Compressive sensing; Convolutional neural network; Dual channel; Dual-channel convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Gearbox fault diagnose; Helical gear box; Modulation signal bispectrum; Noncontact measurements; Thermal images; acoustics; electricity; information processing; mobile phone; reproducibility; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

A commonly solution is knowledge distillation (KD) using teacher-student models. Through the distillation process, the student model can acquire knowledge from the teacher model to enhance performance without introducing extra parameters. However, when using a powerful teacher model, distillation performance is not always ideal. This is because a more powerful teacher model can generate more specific classification strategies, which may result in poorer distillation performance. To this end, the multi-assistant knowledge distillation (MAKD) method is proposed, which bridges the gap between the teacher-student models by incorporating several intermediate-sized assistant models. Moreover, these teacher assistant models have the same architecture, which creates a better knowledge transfer condition at the logit layer. To further optimize the network structure to improve the distillation performance, decreasing threshold channel pruning (DTCP) is proposed to generate the required assistant models. DTCP leverages the scatter value of the decreasing function to prune the channels of the teacher model, which retains more channels close to the output layer. Finally, 4-class and 10-class classification experiments are conducted on two bearing datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DTCP-MAKD method improves distillation performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art KD methods.

However, fault types keep increasing with the change in the working state of mechanical equipment in practical scenarios, which causes the performance of traditional machine learning models to degrade rapidly. Incremental learning can continuously learn new knowledge from incremental information while retaining previously learned knowledge, effectively enhancing the generalization performance of the model to meet the needs of fault diagnosis in actual industrial scenarios. Moreover, the noise environment will have a certain effect on the performance of the model. Therefore, this paper proposes a new incremental learning method using classification and feature level information, which aims to improve the robustness of the model under noisy condition. First, an adaptive dual-branch residual network is constructed, and weights are assigned through an adaptive algorithm to enable the model to retain old knowledge while learning new knowledge. Then, an adversarial network is used to reduce the differences at the feature level after the samples pass through the model of different phases, which ensures the sustainable learning ability of the model and promotes knowledge transfer between different phases. Meanwhile, catastrophic forgetting is overcome through the knowledge distillation loss. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper outperforms the current popular incremental learning method.

However, existing fault diagnosis methods are mainly based on single modal data set. In addition, fault diagnosis method based on multi-head attention mechanism has been paid increasing attention. And the mechanism has the advantage of extracting global information and parallel computing structure. But this structure has a large number of redundant parameters, which affect the speed of computational prediction and the storage space of the computer. In this paper, a novel multi-modal multi-head attention fault diagnosis method with decision fusion and parameter pruning is proposed to alleviate the above problems. Firstly, multiple sub-models based on multi-head attention mechanism with parameter pruning are trained by different modal data to obtain several fault predicted results. Then, these fault predicted results are fused to achieve more accurate fault diagnosis result. The experiment shows that the proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the models using single modal data. © 2023 IEEE.","Decision fusion; Fault diagnosis; Motor; Multi-head attention","Digital storage; Fault detection; Modal analysis; Attention mechanisms; Decisions fusion; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Modal data; Motor fault; Motor systems; Multi-head attention; Network-based; Single-modal; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

This violates the crucial Functional Safety (FuSa) of the DL accelerator, maintaining which is imperative in high assurance applications. Conventional techniques for error localization incur high test efforts, without regards to the unique challenges posed by DL systems. In this direction, we propose DiagNNose, a two-tier machine learning-based error localization framework for on-line fault management in DL accelerators. We develop a novel diagnostic pattern selection algorithm to obtain a minimal subset of functional test patterns, that are executed in the accelerator in mission mode. By extracting and analyzing dataflow-based features from the intermediate computations of the General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) core, a lightweight multi-layer perceptron accomplishes bit-level error localization in 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit datapath units with high fidelity. We have limited ourselves to a single accelerator design, i.e., the Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA) architecture to evaluate our proposed DiagNNose framework. On executing state-of-the-art deep neural networks trained on ImageNet; error localization using only 30 diagnostic functional test patterns demonstrate up to 98.4% diagnosability, thereby demonstrating an improvement of 54.63% over a random test pattern set, with as low as 4.95% overhead in the DL accelerator in mission mode.

Graph convolutional networks have achieved some results in the study of fault diagnosis, but the way of topology construction from a single metric space is somewhat inexact and one-sided. Meanwhile, graph convolutional networks can only aggregate node features in the spatial dimension, which does not guarantee a comprehensive expression of fault information. Therefore, we propose a gearbox fault diagnosis method based on refined topology and spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks to accurately identify the gearbox health state. First, two topologies are constructed based on the distance metric and the similarity metric, respectively, and the edge structure is pruned to obtain a more lightweight topology based on the analysis of the structural similarity between the two. Then, depending on the number of common neighbors of two nodes, the weights between them are enhanced or weakened to further refine the topological information. Finally, a network model with spatio-temporal feature co-extraction is developed to mine fault features in depth in two dimensions to improve network performance. Case studies, ablation experiments, and robustness validation of the proposed method are carried out, and the results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is as high as 99.41% and 99.93% on the two datasets, respectively, which is much higher than that of other comparison methods, and at the same time, it has good noise robustness.

The working environment of the bearing is complex including high load, high pressure, and high temperature, so the failure probability is high. So the vibration signals of bearings are often accompanied by a large amount of noise, leading to unstable signal data characteristics. Aiming at the characteristics of data instability and a large number of complex noises, an adaptive threshold denoising (WTAT) method based on improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN) combined with wavelet transform is proposed. Then combined with an improved SqueezeNet model, an accurate diagnosis of rolling bearing fault was achieved. Firstly, the ICEEMDAN is used for mode decomposition to obtain a sequence of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which effectively solves the mode aliasing and pseudo-mode problems of traditional empirical mode decomposition. Moreover, the WTAT noise reduction is carried out for several IMFs with the least correlation, which effectively solves the problem of over-strangling and over-retention of traditional wavelet denoising. Then, in order to better integrate local features and global dependencies, the dual attention convolutional module is embedded in the fire module of SqueezeNet and a lightweight model named dasqueeezenet is built for bearing fault diagnosis. Finally, compared with common convolutional neural networks such as VGG16, ResNet and Xception, the presented method achieves remarkable results in terms of the accuracy with 96.17%, the precision with 96.3%, the recall rate with 96.42% and the F1-Score with 96.26%, and the presented model's effectiveness in diagnosing rolling bearing faults has been demonstrated. © 2023 IEEE.","Dual Attention Network; Fault Diagnosis; Improved Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise; SqueezeNet; Wavelet Transform Adaptive Threshold Denoising","Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Intrinsic mode functions; Roller bearings; Wavelet decomposition; Adaptive noise; Adaptive thresholds; Dual attention network; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Faults diagnosis; Improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise; Squeezenet; Threshold de-noising; Wavelet transform adaptive threshold denoising; Wavelets transform; Empirical mode decomposition","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

However, there is currently insufficient study on thermal parameters, and the in-depth fusion analysis of multiple parameter associations has not been realized. At the same time, considering the numerous thermal parameters of internal combustion engines and the complex relationship between them.

However, the traditional continual learning based on knowledge distillation keeps the absolute positions of samples in representation spaces to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which limits new fault samples to embedding into representation spaces flexibly. To address this issue, a continual learning method based on a novel knowledge distillation strategy is proposed for motor fault diagnosis. At incremental stages of continual learning, new and old diagnosis networks are first regarded as the teacher and student networks. Then, the improved distillation strategy is designed to guide knowledge transfer from teacher networks to student networks, meanwhile, student networks learn from the new fault samples. Finally, new diagnosis networks are obtained which can diagnose incremental fault classes. For the improved knowledge distillation strategy, knowledge is inherited by maintaining the proximity behavior of samples in the representation spaces, thereby networks can learn to map samples into representation spaces more flexibly. Through a study case of class-Added fault diagnosis of motors, it is proved that the proposed method can improve diagnostic accuracy during continual learning.  © 2023 IEEE.","continual learning; intelligent fault diagnosis; knowledge distillation; representation proximity; Three-phase motor","Failure analysis; Fault detection; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Students; Continual learning; Faults diagnosis; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Knowledge distillation; Learning methods; Motor fault; Representation proximity; Representation space; Student network; Three phase motor; Distillation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Currently, loss measurements can be performed by model-driven and data-driven approaches. However, poor operating conditions can lead to system sensing errors, which can significantly reduce the accuracy and speed of measurement. To deal with this problem, we propose a digital twin architecture and constructs a data-driven learning model. The model, DTformer, is embedded in the digital twin architecture. And it has three remarkable processes: encoder-decoder based random feature extraction, loss measurement transfer learning and knowledge distillation. These processes extract parameter information and topology features from the data of UHVDC. The model has good accuracy, response time and resistance to the missing data. The comparison experiment shows that DTformer outperforms popular feature extraction models with an average decrease of 38.80&#x0025; in RMSE and 42.82&#x0025; in MAE, and the best R2 value is closest to 1. The analyses of lightweight and missingness show that the DTformer also has significant response time improvement and missing resistance. Finally, we also implement the visualization of digital twin to enable operators to perform monitoring, computation, analysis and management of UHVDC.

However, owing to the deployment cost, numerous CNNs with large parameters are difficult to be directly applied to industrial practice. Therefore, this work aims to use lower parameters (order of magnitude is thousand) to complete the task of bearing fault diagnosis on the premise that the model has high-accuracy. To achieve this goal, a convolution unit modified by transformer was proposed, who is based upon the self-activation function, which makes the transformer and CNN organically integrated into a whole. Then, based on this unit, a series of novel lightweight diagnosis frameworks were proposed, named SANet. Finally, it was demonstrated that the proposed SANet can complete the high-accuracy diagnosis task with less than three thousand parameters and has strong robustness to noise (Average accuracy in various noise environments: 84.55%), and that SANet can achieve satisfactory results when there are few training samples (The number of samples of each category is 3 × 4), through four research cases. To sum up, based on this novel unit, we provide a series of lightweight frameworks with high-accuracy, strong robustness, and low sample demand, which is expected to promote the process of fault diagnosis technology from theoretical research to industrial practice. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-noise; Fault diagnosis; Lightweight; Limited sample; Self-activation function","Chemical activation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Industrial research; Activation functions; Antinoise; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; High-accuracy; Industrial practices; Lightweight; Limited sample; Self-activation; Self-activation function; Convolution","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, cost and delay factors make it difficult for their widespread industrial application. Microcontroller units (MCUs) in industrial equipment have the advantages of real-time response and high reliability and usually have some redundant computational resource. However, even lightweight deep learning models cannot be deployed in MCUs due to severely limited computational resources. This paper proposes an end-edge collaborative fault diagnosis framework, by combining real-time decision-making at the end with dynamic adaptive diagnosis at the edge to improve inference performance. The model's minimum input size is deduced through theoretical analysis of the bearing working mechanism, and to make the model suitable for MCUs, we leverage the differential characteristics of the bearing vibration data and proposed a TinyML model based on stacked autoencoders. The pre-autoencoder extracts differential features, while the post-autoencoder performs fault diagnosis based on pooled differential features. Finally, the stacked-autoencoder model and collaborative framework were evaluated using the CWRU bearing dataset, achieving 384x compression in parameter size and 100% accuracy for binary fault classification, requiring only 6.44kB RAM. With the dynamic adaptive collaboration mechanism, the proposed fault diagnosis framework can reduce the edge load by approximately 94%.  © 2023 IEEE.","deep learning; differential feature; end-edge collaboration; Fault diagnosis; stacked autoencoder; TinyML","Classification (of information); Decision making; Deep learning; Fault detection; Learning systems; Microcontrollers; Vibration analysis; Auto encoders; Deep learning; Differential feature; End-edge collaboration; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Microcontroller unit; Performance; Stacked autoencoder; Tinyml; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The thermoeconomic model of a refinery can show that the effects of faults generally propagate through the whole process and affect the behavior of several components, resulting in induced malfunction in typical components. This study aims to estimate the primary source of inefficiency and, therefore, the main reason for the increase in irreversibility and entering feed into the refinery due to changes in some operating conditions. Operating conditions in 2013 and 2023 are defined as base mode and operating mode, respectively. The results of exergy cost analysis show that Liquefied Petroleum Gases (LPG) unit and H2S removal unit have the greatest impact on reducing the overall performance of the refinery in 2023, while this unit is one of the units with the least exergy destruction in the base year. The share of the environment and fuel oil unit, LPG unit, H2S removal unit, and kerosene treating unit in increasing the irreversibility of the utility unit is 4,898.18, 1200.67, 935.15, 642.73, and 624.45 GJ/day, respectively. The share of the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU) in the reduction of the irreversibility of the utility unit is 7,316.67. The results show that the total resource consumption has increased by 168 MJ/day. Therefore, in order to reduce resource consumption in 2030 (operational mode), the impact of LPG and H2S removal units on utility irreversibility should be controlled. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Exergy analysis; Exergy cost accounting; Malfunction diagnosis; Oil refinery; Resource consumption","Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Exergy; Petroleum refineries; Exergy Analysis; Exergy cost; Exergy cost accounting; Malfunction diagnosis; Off design condition; Oil quality; Oil refineries; Operating condition; Resources consumption; Thermoeconomic analysis; Liquefied petroleum gas","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Despite the great success of convolutional neural network (CNN) in feature extraction, most of them are based on manual tuning, and it is not easy to determine a unified CNN architecture with an effective balance between accuracy and computational resources (parameters and floating point operations (FLOPs)). In this paper, an automatic CNN architecture design method called AUTO-CNN is proposed to address the above issues. First, a novel representation learning method based on spatial-temporal tensors is proposed, in which AUTO-CNN can use two-dimensional multi-scale convolutions to capture more feature hierarchy, i.e., temporal variabilities and spatial characteristics. Second, unlike most of the current non-task-specific studies that establish deeper and more complex networks for better performance, this paper investigates the lightweight CNNs with limited resource under task-specific applications. Finally, to speed up the design process, an efficient hierarchical encoding strategy and space exploration strategy are proposed to avoid inefficient architecture generation and reduce CNNs training time. Experiments on four real-world BFD tasks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the peer competitors, including machine learning, deep learning and other CNN-based methods.

Most currently available CNN-based diagnostic models are developed under the presumption that the acquired mechanical signals are invulnerable to noise. However, transmission systems usually operate under fluctuating conditions (e.g., variable speed and strong noise scenarios), making the fault-related pulse information in the mechanical signal easily swamped by noise. Therefore, it is challenging for these existing approaches to achieve satisfactory results in industrial scenarios. To deal with this problem, an online knowledge distillation-based multiscale threshold denoising network (OKD-MTDN) is developed in this research work. The main innovations and contributions of this research work include: 1) introducing a novel convolutional module, called the Multiscale Convolutional Module (MCM), alongside a Global Attention Module (GAM), for extracting a range of discriminative features generated from mechanical signals; 2) designing a multi-dilated threshold denoising module (MTDM) to expand the receptive field and filter out interference features; 3) establishing an online knowledge distillation (OKD) algorithm to improve the generalization capability of OKD-MTDN. The hF-MS planetary gearbox dataset and the real-running high-speed rail dataset is utilized to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the developed OKD-MTDN can achieve satisfactory results in various nonstationary scenarios.

However, hardware platforms such as GPUs, TPUs, and workstations are commonly used for the applications of artificial intelligence, which limits the practical applications due to high-power consumption and high cost; the corresponding large amount of computation reduces the inference speed in real-time industrial environments. In this study, we propose a binary neural network accelerator and implement it in a fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for bearing fault diagnosis. By using a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, we extract the features of vibration signals and classify the classes of bearing faults with high accuracy. The model weights are trained with only one bit by using a knowledge distillation and binarization algorithm to reduce the storage space. We adopt the FPGA, a reprogrammable, low-power, low-cost platform for convolutional neural network implementation. The original convolutional operation is replaced with a more efficient algorithm and a specialized binary model computation engine is designed to accelerate model inference and reduce on-chip resource utilization. Experimental results and comparisons are introduced to show the optimized binary model required only 0.42 ms to infer on the hardware platform, which is 150 times faster than a 32-bit floating-point neural network of the same architecture and still maintained a higher testing accuracy of 98.5%.

The rapid and accurate detection of substation equipment in infrared images is one of the key steps for automatic fault diagnosis. However, the complexity of image background, the low contrast of infrared images, and the rotational targets in infrared images pose a great challenge to detection task. This study aims to improve the detection accuracy of the model while having real-time detection speed and propose a lightweight power equipment detection network (PEDNet) based on You Only Look Once (YOLOv4)-tiny. First, a novel global information aggregation module (GIAM) is constructed to guide the network to focus on the salient regions where the target equipment is located. Second, an improved spatial transformer network (ISTN) is introduced to reduce the impact of rotational targets on detection accuracy. Finally, a feature enhanced fusion network (FEFN) is designed through the use of a multiscale feature cross-fusion structure. It can fully fuse the feature information of the salient region, the rotational targets, and the strong semantic information. The experimental results show that the proposed PEDNet can reach 92.66% detection accuracy and 107.07 frames/s real-time detection speed on the testing datasets. Compared with YOLOv4-tiny, there is a small sacrifice in detection speed, but the detection accuracy is improved and significantly higher than the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Feature fusion; infrared image; rotational targets; substation equipment; unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)","Antennas; Electric substations; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Infrared imaging; Interactive computer systems; Job analysis; Object detection; Object recognition; Real time systems; Semantics; Signal detection; Aerial vehicle; Computational modelling; Features extraction; Features fusions; Infrared image; Insulator; Real - Time system; Rotational target; Substation; Substation equipment; Task analysis; Unmanned aerial vehicle; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To address this challenge, incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning models has been proposed. Specifically, prior knowledge in the form of wavelet packet decomposition and information entropy features was extracted to characterize fault-related physical phenomena. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) supplemented this approach by learning general features. An attention mechanism fused the two feature types, emphasizing the prior knowledge. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classification was then applied for fault discrimination. In addition, a self-training method semi-supervised the model during training. The approach was evaluated on three bearing datasets against deep learning and machine learning baselines. Results showed the method achieved over 70% accuracy with only 30 labeled samples per class, outperforming the semi-supervised baseline. This lightweight, knowledge-driven solution provides a foundation for efficient fault diagnosis from limited data in complex fault scenarios. Overall, the study demonstrated an effective method for addressing small sample size challenges in machine fault diagnosis. © 2023 IEEE.","Attention mechanism; prior knowledge embedding; rolling bearings; semi-supervised learning; small samples","Complex networks; Convolution; Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Neural networks; Roller bearings; Supervised learning; Wavelet analysis; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Knowledge embedding; Prior knowledge embedding; Prior-knowledge; Rolling bearings; Semi-supervised learning; Small samples; Wavelet Packet; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The method based on deep learning is used to diagnose and isolate the classic faults of EMA. The simulation model of EMA is modeling according to the working principle and control law. Four typical faults of EMA are studied,including return channel jam, spall, motor fault, and position sensor fault. Sparse Auto Encoder (SAE) algorithm can perform adaptive extraction of sensor data, which preserves dimensionality reduction and compression while preserving important features. Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network is used to effectively process the time series data, which considering both past and future data during the fault diagnosis process. The established EMA model is simulated to obtain normal and faulty data sets, which are used to train the network by SAE-BiLSTM algorithm, and then the trained network is used for online fault diagnosis.

In the simulation study, a distillation column comprising nine trays was adopted. A nonlinear feedback composition controller was designed to track the composition in tray 2 and tray 9 of this distillation column. The actuator and sensor fault detection and isolation system were developed by using a linear sliding mode observer. Fault detection was achieved by comparing the fault estimation signal to a predefined threshold. Fault isolation was achieved by analyzing the maximum value of fault estimation signals and a proposed isolation logic. The control and the fault detection and isolation system were tested via simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the scheme.

The existing diagnosis methods are always proposed based on the data only from a single source and are susceptible to interference. Due to the need to convertthe data into two dimensions, data preprocessing also requires a lot of time. To address these problems, a new fault diagnosis algorithm based on multi-source data and one-dimensional lightweight convolutional neural network is presented. In particular, original data can be exploited directly without conversion to two dimensions. To enhance data fusion, attention module and channel shuffle module are added. Besides, to improve the utilization of data, a modified (Formula presented.) criterion is proposed to remove outliers in multi-source data. The performance of the proposed method in multi-source data fusion is verified in bearing failure experiments. Compared with the existing diagnosis methods (one-dimensional convolutional neural network, ResNet, ShuffleNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet and the two recurrence methods), multi-source data and one-dimensional lightweight convolutional neural network does a better job of balancing the efficiency and robustness. © IMechE 2022.","1D CNN; deep learning; lightweight network; Motor fault diagnosis; multi-source data fusion","Bearings (machine parts); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data fusion; Deep learning; Fault detection; 1d CNN; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Lightweight network; Motor fault; Motor fault diagnose; Multi-source data fusion; Multisource data; One-dimensional; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, the catastrophic forgetting problem remains the most crucial contemporary challenge facing IFD. This paper proposes an incremental fault diagnosis method based on metric feature distillation (MFD) and improved sample memory to solve this problem. First, the metric feature distillation is designed with metric learning methods and feature distillation. It uses distillation and triplet loss to constrain the network parameters of old and new tasks in the same feasible region, effectively alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Then, for a small amount of data that can be stored scenario, an improved sample memory strategy is introduced to reduce catastrophic forgetting further, called the center and hard sample memory (CAHM). It can better preserve the global information of the data, reducing the forgetting of old data information that needs to be preserved during the training process. Experimental results on CWRU and MFPT datasets verify the proposed method's effectiveness.  © 2013 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; incremental learning; knowledge distillation; signal processing","Distillation; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Signal processing; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Incremental fault diagnosis; Incremental learning; Knowledge distillation; Load modeling; Signal-processing; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Given such constraints, an ideal fault diagnosis model should not be either generalizable across the shifting domains or lightweight, but rather a combination of both, generalizable while being minimalistic. Preferably being uninformed about the domain shift. Addressing these computational and data centric challenges, we propose a novel methodology, Convolutional Auto-encoder and Nearest Neighbors based self adaptation (SCAE-NN), that adapts its fault diagnosis model to the changing conditions of a machine. We implemented SCAE-NN for various cross-domain fault diagnosis tasks and compared its performance against the state-of-the-art domain invariant models. Compared to the SOTA, SCAE-NN is at least 6−7% better at predicting fault classes across conditions, while being more than 10 times smaller in size and latency. Moreover, SCAE-NN does not need any labelled target domain data for the adaptation, making it suitable for practical data scarce scenarios.

Existing rolling bearing fault diagnosis algorithms generally have low accuracy in the presence of noise, and there are issues with complex algorithm structures and high computational complexity. Therefore, this paper researches rolling bearing fault diagnosis using a lightweight residual network. First, the signals are preprocessed using the short-time Fourier transform to highlight the impact features of the vibration signals. Then, a lightweight residual network based on channel attention is designed to focus on the impact features of faults, effectively improving the algorithm's ability to extract nonlinear features.

For addressing the low fault diagnosis accuracy caused by time dimension information loss in image coding, the raw vibration signal is converted into the Gram difference field image. The Ghost convolution module is employed to replace the standard convolution layer in the ResNet model, and a Ghost-ResNet model is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis for the purpose of reducing the parameter sizes and floating point operations. To improve the performance of the Ghost-ResNet model, the RAdam optimization algorithm and Gramian angular difference fields image coding method is used for model training. Experiments with single fault and compound fault are performed for verifying the superiority of the proposed Ghost-ResNet model. The comparison results show that the GAF image coding method is more powerful in representing fault features than the other methods, and the RAdam optimization algorithm has achieved stable and higher diagnostic results with faster convergence speed.

Currently, many fault diagnosis methods for BPUs have been developed, and most of them are based on feature or image classification of indicator diagrams. However, low-quality monitoring data and the limited proportion of effective pixels in indicator diagram greatly restrict the performances of these methods. This article proposes an efficient two-step fault diagnosis method for BPUs. In the first step, to overcome the impact of low-quality monitoring data, a dynamic time warping-based matching method is proposed to extract the period of the data, and then a physical model driven method optimized by Bayesian gradient descent is proposed to reconstruct the data. In the second step, to overcome the impact of the limited proportion of effective pixels in indicator diagram, a parallel deep network is proposed which directly takes the time series of the displacement and the load of BPUs as the inputs. Extensive experiments on dataset from 45 real oil wells have shown that, the proposed method can achieve the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, meanwhile the computational load is only 5% of other deep learning-based methods.

Machine learning (ML) methods and Internet of things (IoT) technologies have been recently introduced into machine fault diagnosis and have generated inspiring results. An ML model with more trainable parameters can typically generate a higher fault diagnostic accuracy. However, the IoT nodes have limited computation and storage resources. How to design an ML model with high accuracy and computational efficiency is still a difficulty and challenge. This work develops an enhanced sparse filtering (ESF) method for mining and fusing the features of the machine signals for fault diagnosis. First, a dimension reduction algorithm is utilized for obtaining the principal components of the vibration signals that are hindered by noises. The distinct features of the principal components are then exploited by using sparse filtering (SF). To reduce the overfitting of the SF model, the L1/2 norm is applied to regularize the objective function. Finally, the obtained features are combined as the inputs of a softmax classifier for machine fault pattern recognition. The effectiveness, superiority, and robustness of the proposed ESF method are validated by the simulated signals and the practical bearing and motor fault signals compared with the other conventional methods. The lightweight and intelligent ESF algorithm is also deployed onto an edge computing node to realize online motor fault diagnosis. The designed model and the proposed method show great potential in highly accurate and efficient rotation machine fault diagnosis. © The Author(s) 2023.","edge computing; fault diagnosis; feature extraction; Rotating machine; sparse filtering","Computational efficiency; Edge computing; Fault detection; Internet of things; Pattern recognition; Rotating machinery; Edge computing; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Filtering method; Machine fault diagnosis; Machine learning models; Motor fault; Principal Components; Rotating machine; Sparse filtering; Failure analysis","Article","Article in press","","Scopus"

Transformer fault diagnosis helps to ensure the safety and stability of system operation. The hidden dangers of transformers due to insulation in power systems are usually manifested in the form of partial discharges. In order to detect the deterioration of the insulation in time and avoid safety accidents, the fault identification of power transformers is very important. Aiming at the problem that signal samples are difficult to obtain, a lightweight deep learning model driven by the phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) and the phase resolved pulse sequence (PRPS) is proposed to complete fault type identification. Finally, the experimental results show that compared with single-modal data, multi-modal data driven based model can better exert the generalization ability of deep learning. In addition, the deep learning model is robust to the adjustment of the number of convolution kernels, which helps to adjust the model scale according to actual needs.  © 2022 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; discharge fault identification; power transformer","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Deterioration; Electric power transmission; Fault detection; Modal analysis; Partial discharges; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Discharge fault identification; Fault identifications; Learning models; Power; Power-transmission; Safety and stabilities; Systems operation; Transformer fault diagnosis; Power transformers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Fault Detection, Isolation, Identification, and Recovery (FDIIR) systems are essential for increasing the reliability of lidar sensors. Knowing the influence of different faults on lidar data is the first crucial step towards fault detection for lidar sensors in automated vehicles. We investigate the influences of sensor cover contaminations on the output data, i.e., on the lidar point cloud and full waveform. Different contamination types were applied (dew, dirt, artificial dirt, foam, water, and oil) and the influence on the output data of the single beam lidar RIEGL LD05-A20 and the automotive mechanically spinning lidar Ouster OS1-64 was evaluated. The LD05-A20 measurements show that dew, artificial dirt, and foam lead to unwanted reflections at the sensor cover. Dew, artificial dirt over the entire transmitter, and foam measurements lead to severe faults, i.e., complete sensor blindness. The OS1-64 measurements also show that dew can lead to almost complete sensor blindness. The results look promising for further studies on fault detection and isolation, since the different contamination types lead to different symptom combinations.  © 2020 IEEE.","Autonomous vehicles; fault diagnosis; measurement errors; optical sensors","Chemical detection; Eye protection; Fault detection; Measurement errors; Optical radar; Optical sensors; Pollution detection; Radar measurement; Tracking radar; Vehicles; Automated vehicles; Autonomous Vehicles; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; LIDAR sensors; Output data; Performance degradation; Point cloud compression; Point-clouds; Pollution measurement; Contamination","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, feature reconstruction from compressed observations has always been a challenge. A novel compressed feature reconstruction method for the impulse response signal caused by localized damage is proposed based on the generalized minimax-concave (GMC) penalty. To improve the efficiency of compression and reconstruction, the fault signal is divided into several segments before compression, and the segmented sparse coefficient is obtained by solving a GMC problem. The fault-caused impulse signal is obtained by combining all the reconstructed segments together. Furthermore, a strategy of regularization parameter selection based on the sparse coefficient proxy is presented. Compared with the commonly used l1 regularization-based reconstruction method, the proposed method can better preserve the amplitudes of impulse features. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further verified by simulation and experimental data. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed sensing; Feature reconstruction; Generalized minimax-concave penalty; Localized fault","Condition monitoring; Digital storage; Fault detection; Impulse response; Signal reconstruction; Compressed-Sensing; Data storage; Data-transmission; Faults diagnosis; Feature reconstruction; Generalized minimax; Generalized minimax-concave penalty; Localized fault; Mechanical; Reconstruction method; Compressed sensing","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, implementing a deep learning model on a limited resources platform such as the smartphone or STM32 includes two difficulties: making the model as lightweight as possible and reducing the dependence on large training samples. To this end, a self-attention ensemble lightweight model combined with the transfer learning (SLTL) method is proposed to solve these intractable problems, which are “small, light, and fast.” Firstly, the raw vibration signal is constructed into time–frequency images by continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Secondly, we build a self-attention lightweight convolutional neural network (SLCNN) model by integrating a self-attention mechanism (SAM) into the optimized SqueezeNet model. Then, based on a well-trained SLCNN in ImageNet, rich parameter knowledge is transferred from the pre-trained model to the target model. Finally, the fever training samples are used to fine-tune the target model. Experimental results on two bearing datasets validate the effectiveness of the SLTL method, which achieves 99.5% of classification accuracy with fewer training samples than other conventional CNN models. More importantly, the model parameters of SLTL are 0.95 M, and the floating-point operations (FLOPs) are 0.11 M, indicating that SLTL possesses high accuracy while maintaining lightweight, which benefits the platform with limited resources. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fine-tuning; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Self-attention mechanism; Transfer learning","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Digital arithmetic; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Sampling; Wavelet transforms; Attention mechanisms; Bearing fault diagnosis; Convolutional neural network; Fine tuning; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Learning models; Self-attention mechanism; Target model; Training sample; Transfer learning; Article; attention; continuous wavelet transform; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnostic error; nonhuman; training; transfer of learning; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus"

To accurately reflect the condition of the engine, this article provides a novel fault diagnosis method for the TFE-731 turbofan engine and develops an online diagnosis system. With the combinations of model-based and data-driven approaches, models are constructed to create the so-called digital twins of the engine parameters. For the model-based approach, the physical isentropic compression is used as the basis of the model. For the data-driven approach, the fast orthogonal search is utilized to ensure that the model outputs close to the real engine data. Based on the model prediction-based monitoring strategy, the status of the engine can be identified online. By using the proposed method, an alarm will be triggered once the tested engine outputs cross the boundaries generated by the digital twins. This method can be further applied in quality control to examine the abnormal parts of an aircraft engine. Finally, the digital twins' online diagnosis system is realized in the practical TFE-731 test facility, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.","Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model; fast orthogonal search (FOS); fault diagnosis; turbofan engine modeling","Aircraft engines; Digital twin; Engines; Search engines; Complicated structures; Data-driven approach; Diagnosis methods; Fast orthogonal searches; Fault diagnosis method; Isentropic compression; Model based approach; Monitoring strategy; Turbofan engines","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Acoustic emission (AE) signal, which is more sensitive to a weak fault, is selected for fault diagnosis of the RV reducer. The high sampling frequency and big data are the challenges for AE signal store and analysis. This study combines compressed sensing (CS) and convolutional neural networks. As a result, data redundancy is significantly reduced while retaining most of the information, and the analysis efficiency is improved. Firstly, the time-domain AE signal was projected into the compression domain to obtain the compression signal; then, the wavelet packet decomposition in the compressed domain was performed to obtain the information of each frequency band. Next, the frequency band information was sent into the input layer of the multi-channel convolutional layer, and the energy pooling layer mines the energy characteristics of each frequency band. Finally, the softmax classifier was used to classify and predict different fault types of RV reducers. The self-fabricated RV reducer experimental platform was used to verify the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the fault features in the AE signal of the RV reducer, improve the efficiency of signal processing and analysis, and achieve the accurate classification of RV reducer faults. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the following two challenges still exist: 1) most existing CNN-based diagnostic models are developed under the assumption that the motor operates under stable conditions; however, the mechanical vibration signals are often collected from various nonstationary scenarios (e.g., variable-speed and noisy scenarios), so the fault-related fluctuation information are easily overwhelmed by interference noise; and 2) previous studies often adopt a large multiscale CNN architecture to extract abundant features, which will inevitably introduces more parameters. In this study, we devote to developing a lightweight multiscale CNN model for motor fault identification under nonstationary conditions. First of all, inspired by the human vision systems, two lightweight hierarchical perception modules (HPMs), namely HPM1 and HPM2 are introduced. Specifically, HPMs adopt dilated convolutions with various kernels to model human receptive fields and use a dense connection strategy to simulate the visual hierarchies. HPM1 and HPM2 can extract rich multiscale features for fault classification tasks. Second, a joint attention module is explored to guide the model not only to pay attention to local spatial-wise information but also to global channel-wise information. Finally, a lightweight multiscale CNN model named coupled visual perceptual network (CVPN) is proposed based on the aforementioned improvements.

Traditional fault diagnosis methods perform poorly in the diagnosis of rolling bearings under complex conditions. In this paper, a feature transfer learning model based on improved DenseNet and joint distribution adaptation (FT-IDJ) is proposed. With this model, we apply it to implement rolling bearing fault diagnosis. A lightweight DenseNet model is firstly proposed to extract the transferable features of the raw vibration signal. Furthermore, the parameters in the DenseNet are constrained by the domain adaptive regularization term and pseudo label learning. The marginal distribution discrepancy and the conditional distribution discrepancy of the learned transferable features are reduced by this way. The proposed method is validated by the diagnosis experiments with CWRU and Jiangnan University rolling bearing datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed FT-IDJ can classify common rolling bearing faults such as inner ring fault, outer ring fault and rolling element fault. Also, it has higher classification accuracy than DAN and other eight methods, which demonstrates its effectively learning transferable features from auxiliary data.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","DenseNet; feature transfer; joint distribution adaptation; rolling bearing fault diagnosis","Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Bearing fault diagnosis; Densenet; Fault diagnosis method; Feature transfers; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Joint distribution adaptation; Joint distributions; Mechanical; Rolling bearing fault diagnose; Rolling bearings; Roller bearings","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Despite its popularity, PCA suffers from the limitations of poor interpretability and robustness. In order to improve the PCA model, this article considers a structured sparse method - Laplace sparse principal component analysis (LSPCA), by integrating domain knowledge and sparsity constraint in the form of Laplace matrix and elastic net regularization constraint. Different from previous work, this article focuses on the advantages brought by the Laplace matrix and sparsity constraint on revealing the true latent process structure. When variable correlations are known in advance, the Laplace matrix can help extract sparse principal components that are consistent with the variable correlations. The increased accuracy of extracted latent process structure enhances the capability of PCA in soft sensing.

In our analyzed silicon data, we observe that 8.76% of scan chain failures have such two faulty chains. We propose a technique to help address this problem, separating the superposition of chain fault effects to diagnose these chips. This technique first uses jump simulation to identify and classify failures that are attributable to only one of the faulty chains. It then uses commercial tools to diagnose the classified failures of each chain individually. Experiments are conducted on both simulated and silicon test data to show the efficacy of our technique, and the proposed method showed improvements over standard diagnosis with commercial tools in resolution (2.38 candidates) and accuracy (92.0%).

The reference motor is driven by a four-leg converter, which can be reconfigured in case of a phase fault by enabling the control of the central point of the motor Y-connection. A crucial design point entails the development of fault detection and isolation (FDI) algorithms capable of minimizing the failure transients and avoiding the short circuit extension. The proposed fault-tolerant control is composed of two sections: the first one applies a novel FDI algorithm for short circuit faults based on the trajectory tracking of the motor current phasor in the Clarke plane; the second one implements the fault accommodation, by applying a reference frame transformation technique to the post-fault commands. The control effectiveness is assessed via nonlinear simulations by characterizing the FDI latency and the post-fault performances. The proposed technique demonstrates excellent potentialities: the FDI algorithm simultaneously detects and isolates the considered faults, even with very limited extensions, during both stationary and unsteady operating conditions. In addition, the proposed accommodation technique is very effective in minimizing the post-fault torque ripples. © 2022 by the authors.","all-electric propulsion; electric machines; fault diagnosis; fault-tolerant control; inter-turn short circuit; modelling; simulation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Although deep learning methods have achieved excellent results for rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the performance of most methods declines sharply when the working conditions change. To address this issue, we propose a one-dimensional lightweight deep subdomain adaptation network (1D-LDSAN) for faster and more accurate rolling bearing fault diagnosis. The framework uses a one-dimensional lightweight convolutional neural network backbone for the rapid extraction of advanced features from raw vibration signals. The local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD) is employed to match the probability distribution between the source domain and the target domain data, and a fully connected neural network is used to identify the fault classes. Bearing data from the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) datasets were used to validate the performance of the proposed framework under different working conditions. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy for 12 tasks was higher for the 1D-LDSAN than for mainstream transfer learning methods.

It addresses the issue of network bandwidth limitation during wireless data transmission and the problem of relying on expert experience and insufficient training samples in traditional fault diagnosis. The continuous wavelet transform was combined with the AlexNet convolutional neural network using transfer learning and the compressed theory of sense. The original vibration signal was compressed and reconstructed using the compressed sampling orthogonal matching pursuit reconstruction algorithm. A continuous wavelet transform was used to convert the compressed signal into a time–frequency image. The pretrained AlexNet model was selected as the migration object, the network model was fine-tuned and retrained, and the trained AlexNet model was used to diagnose the fault using the model-based migration method. It was demonstrated by the experimental results when the compression ratio CR = 0.5. Compared to other network models, the classification accuracy rate is 97.78%.

A lightweight bearing fault diagnosis method based on depthwise separable convolutions is proposed. The proposed method can simultaneously extract different features from vibration signals in different directions to enhance the stability of the diagnosis model. The lightweight unit based on depthwise separable convolutions in the feature extraction layer reduces the size of the model and the number of parameters that need to be learned. The vibration signals of bearings in different directions are converted into time-frequency signals by the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then into pictures as the input of the model. In order to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the method, this paper uses the gearbox data set of Southeast University and the CWRU (Case Western Reserve University) bearing data set for experiments. Comparisons of bearing fault diagnosis results using the proposed model with other classical deep learning models are implemented. The results show that the proposed model is superior to other classical deep learning models; thus, it has a smaller model size, higher accuracy, and less computation burden. Compared with using a single-direction vibration signal as input, the proposed model that uses multiple vibration signals in different directions as input has more accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.","bearing; deep learning; depthwise separable convolutions; fault diagnosis; lightweight","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To accurately identify the fault pattern, large amounts of vibration data must be sampled and saved. However, because the bandwidth of the wireless communication is limited, the volume of transmitted data cannot be too large. Therefore, raw data are usually compressed before transmission. All of the previous compression methods use a sample-then-compress framework; however, in this work, we introduce a compression method based on a Compressive Sensing that can simultaneously collect and compress raw data. Additionally, a hybrid measurement matrix is designed for Compressive Sensing and used to compress the data and make it easy to conduct fault diagnosis in the compression domain. This process can significantly reduce the computational complexity of on-board fault diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed compression method is easy to use and the reconstruction process can recover the original signal perfectly. Above all, the compressed signal can preserve the time series information of the original signal, and in contrast to fault diagnosis using the original signal, the accuracy of the fault diagnosis based on conventional methods in the compression domain is not significantly decreased. © 2021 Zihan Chen.","Compressive sensing; Data compression; Remote fault diagnosis; Rolling bearing","Compressed sensing; Condition monitoring; Data compression; Fault detection; Roller bearings; Signal reconstruction; Bearing fault diagnosis; Compression domain; Compression methods; Compressive sensing; Faults diagnosis; Machine condition monitoring; Original signal; Remote fault diagnose; Remote machines; Rolling bearings; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Most of the existing CNN models are developed on the assumption that the collected data is high-quality. However, since rotating machinery usually operates under fluctuating conditions, the critical pulse information of the measured vibration signals is easily submerged in noise. To promote the adaptability of CNN in noisy industrial scenes, an attention-based multiscale denoising residual convolutional neural network (AM-DRCN) is put forward in this study. First of all, a multiscale denoising module (MDM) is introduced as the basic building unit to help the network explore multiscale features and filter out irrelevant information. Then, a feature enhancement module (FEM) is leveraged to expand the receptive field and make full use of the side-out features. Further, a joint attention module (JAM) is explored to integrate the extracted features effectively. Finally, a lightweight CNN model named AM-DRCN is developed based on the above improvements. The practicality and effectiveness of AM-DRCN for monitoring machine health and stability states are verified through three case studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Fault diagnosis; Feature enhancement module (FEM); Joint attention module (JAM); Multiscale denoising module (MDM); Vibration signals","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Fault detection; Rotating machinery; CNN models; Convolutional neural network; De-noising; Faults diagnosis; Feature enhancement; Feature enhancement module; Joint attention; Joint attention module; Multiscale denoising module; Vibration signal; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The technological level limitation leads to the surface faults of the steel, thus the key to improving fluid components quality is to diagnose the faults in steel production. The complex shape and small size of steel surface faults result in the low accuracy of the diagnosis, and the large size of the network leads to poor real-time performance. Therefore, aiming at the problems, an improved YOLOV5 is proposed. Firstly, to reduce the feature information loss, coordinate attention is used to improve YOLOV5, thus the diagnosis ability can be improved. Secondly, to further reduce the loss, a new connection is constructed in YOLOV5, and the detection ability can also be further improved. Thirdly, to improve the real-time performance of the fault diagnosis, YOLOV5 is improved by the lightweight method ShuffleNetV2, and its size can be reduced. Lastly, to further improve the accuracy, the cosine annealing with warm restarts algorithm is used to optimize YOLOV5. The dataset of NEU-DET is verified and testified.

To address the above issues, this paper designs an improved fully connected layer (FC) layer in the multilayer perceptron model that can be used for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Based on this idea, this paper proposes a “Reshape, Linear, Transpose, Linear” fully connected layer replacement strategy (RLTL) by using the Kronecker decomposition method. This method decomposes the weight matrix, converting one linear operation to two linear operations in the FC layer, which results in a significant reduction in the total number of parameters and calculations. On this foundation, this paper also uses one-dimensional convolution to improve the current mainstream two-dimensional lightweight convolutional neural networks and lightweight strategies, and designs nine alternative modules. The results show that the proposed RLTL module replacement scheme decreases the number of parameters of the multilayer perceptron to less than 1%, reduces the number of calculations to less than 10%, and increases the diagnostic accuracy by more than 30% in a small-sample and noise-free environment. In addition, this paper also verifies and compares the effects of different transformation methods of convolutional neural networks in each alternative module on small sample diagnosis and noise immunity diagnosis of rolling bearings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Fault diagnosis; Lightweight convolutional neural network; Multilayer perceptron; Rolling bearing","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Decomposition methods; Fault detection; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Roller bearings; Bearing fault diagnosis; Complexes structure; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Lightweight convolutional neural network; Linear operations; Multilayers perceptrons; Neural network model; Rolling bearings; Small samples; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Existing methods for fault diagnosis typically collect sound signals on site and transmit them to a back-end server for analysis, which may fail to provide a real-time response due to transmission packet loss and latency. However, the limited computing power of edge devices and the existing methods for feature extraction pose a significant challenge to performing diagnosis on the edge. In this paper, we propose a fast Lightweight Fault Diagnosis method for power transformers, referred to as LightFD, which integrates several technical components. Firstly, before feature extraction, we design an asymmetric Hamming-cosine window function to reduce signal spectrum leakage and ensure data integrity. Secondly, we design a multidimensional spatio-temporal feature extraction method to extract acoustic features. Finally, we design a parallel dual-layer, dual-channel lightweight neural network to realize the classification of different fault types on edge devices with limited computing power. Extensive simulation and experimental results show that the diagnostic precision and recall of LightFD reach 94.64% and 95.33%, which represent an improvement of 4% and 1.6% over the traditional SVM method, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.","fault diagnosis; Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC); power transformer; sound signal; spectrogram","Computer Simulation; Electric Power Supplies; Intelligence; Neural Networks, Computer; Computing power; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Multilayer neural networks; Power transformers; Support vector machines; Computing power; Edge intelligence; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Mel frequency cepstrum coefficient; Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients; Power faults; Real-time fault diagnosis; Sound signal; Spectrograms; computer simulation; intelligence; power supply; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

When the bearing fails, if it cannot be found and repaired in time, it will cause great economic losses. Time-frequency analysis has been widely used for bearing fault signals under non-stationary operating conditions, but the existing methods have problems such as poor adaptability under multiple operating conditions. At the same time, the low time-frequency resolution and poor energy aggregation also affect the fault feature extraction effect. Aiming at these problems, this paper proposes a bearing fault detection method, which combines empirical mode decomposition and adaptive time-varying parameter short-time Fourier synchronous squeezing transform (AFSST), it solves the problem of adapting to signals under multiple operating conditions; A weighted least squares estimation time-varying parameter algorithm is proposed, which improves the calculation speed by 29% under the premise of ensuring the calculation accuracy; A time-varying index of energy effective compression ratio is proposed to accurately measure the time-varying energy aggregation of time-frequency analysis methods. Using short-time Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform, wavelet synchrosqueezed transform, and AFSST to analyze the simulated FM signal, the results show that the AFSST transform has better time-frequency resolution and higher energy-efficient compression rate globally.

Nevertheless, the traditional intelligent diagnosis methods are often based on the premise of sufficient annotation signals and balanced distribution of classes, and the model structure is so complex that it requires huge computational resources. To this end, a lightweight class imbalanced diagnosis framework based on a depthwise separable Laplace-wavelet convolution network with variable-asymmetric focal loss (DSLWCN-VAFL) is established. Firstly, a branch with few parameters for time-frequency feature extraction is designed by integrating wavelet and depthwise separable convolution. It is combined with the branch of regular convolution that fully learns time-domain features to jointly capture abundant discriminative features from limited samples. Subsequently, a new asymmetric soft-threshold loss, VAFL, is designed, which reasonably rebalances the contributions of distinct samples during the model training. Finally, experiments are conducted on the data of bearing and gearbox, which demonstrate the superiority of the DSLWCN-VAFL algorithm and its lightweight diagnostic framework in handling class imbalanced data. © 2022 by the authors.","class imbalanced data; fault diagnosis; Laplace wavelet; loss function; small sample","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Aiming at the problems of the complex and changeable working environment of rolling bearings and limited computing ability, fault feature information cannot be effectively extracted, and the current deep learning model is difficult to be compatible with lightweight and high efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a fault detection method for power equipment based on an energy spectrum diagram and deep learning. Firstly, a novel two-dimensional time-frequency feature representation method and energy spectrum feature map based on wavelet packet transform is proposed, and an energy spectrum feature map dataset is made for subsequent diagnosis. This method can realize multi-resolution analysis, fully extract the feature information contained in the fault signal, and accelerate the convergence of the subsequent diagnosis model. Secondly, a lightweight residual dense convolutional neural network model (LR-DenseNet) is proposed. This model combines the advantages of residual learning and a dense connection, and can not only extract deep features more easily, but can also effectively use shallow features. Then, based on the lightweight residual dense convolutional neural network model, an LR-DenseSENet model is proposed. By introducing the transfer learning strategy and adding the channel domain, an attention mechanism is added to the channel feature fusion layer, with the accuracy of detection up to 99.4%, and the amount of parameter calculation greatly reduced to one-fifth of that of VGG. Finally, through an experimental analysis, it is verified that the fault detection model designed in this paper based on the combination of an energy spectrum feature map and LR-DenseSENet achieves a satisfactory detection effect. © 2022 by the authors.","channel domain attention; Dense Residual Networks; energy spectrum feature map; fault detection; power equipment; smart grid; transfer learning","Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Physical Phenomena; Wavelet Analysis; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electric power transmission networks; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Manufacture; Neural network models; Roller bearings; Smart power grids; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Channel domain attention; Dense residual network; Energy spectrum; Energy spectrum feature map; Faults detection; Feature map; Power equipment; Smart grid; Spectra features; Transfer learning; physical phenomena; wavelet analysis; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Process engineers and plant managers are expected to understand, assimilate and use this huge data bank for the detection of anomalies in the systems. Close monitoring of these data and trend detection becomes an uphill task for any individual handling these data. So, it is a challenge for them to monitor all these data simultaneously and come to concrete conclusions. But as is observed, these process variables or parameters showcase a unique behavior. Multiple variables interact simultaneously to govern such processes. ""Multivariate Statistical methods""like ""Principal Component Analysis""(PCA) exploit these characteristics and help to compress the information coming from numerous variables. The objective of developing a monitoring system based on multivariate analysis is to diagnose anomalies well in advance to minimize losses happening due to slippage and flaring in an extractive distillation column. The case studied here shows that the model can successfully predict when the distillation system starts to deviate from the normal operating conditions well before operators diagnose the problem and the system issues an alarm. The contribution of this multivariate method of monitoring petrochemical processes is that it can be used on a real-time basis and the product recovery in the extractive distillation process can be maximized. Additionally, this makes it easier to run the process without incurring losses, and downstream processes are more stable.  © 2022 IEEE.","multivariate statistical approach; performance monitoring of extractive distillation column; Principal component analysis; Process equipment monitoring","Data handling; Distillation; Distillation columns; Fault detection; Multivariant analysis; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; Equipment monitoring; Extractive distillation; Multivariate statistical approaches; Performance monitoring of extractive distillation column; Performance-monitoring; Petrochemical process; Principal-component analysis; Process equipment monitoring; Process equipments; Process parameters; Principal component analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In engineering, it is hard to collect all fault mode data in advance. However, the existing IFD-trained models usually do not have the ability to continue to learn and expand. It is also costly to retrain IFD models when new fault modes data arrives. To solve this drawback, this paper proposes a new incremental training framework for IFD model updating. The framework increases the model's ability to diagnose new fault modes by adding new linear classification nodes to the original model. Cross-entropy and knowledge distillation loss are used to avoid catastrophic forgetting, and a new dynamic weight allocation strategy is introduced to solve the stability plasticity dilemma. Finally, stable and reliable incremental training and dynamic updating of the IFD model are realized. The proposed method is applied to incremental fault diagnosis of bearings. The results show that the IFD model applied with the proposed framework has high accuracy in incremental diagnosis tasks, which provides a new solution for the expansion of the IFD model.  © 2022 IEEE.","deep learning; fault diagnosis; incremental learning","Deep learning; Distillation; Fault detection; Deep learning; Dynamic weight; Fault modes; Faults diagnosis; Incremental learning; Incremental training; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Intelligent fault diagnosis model; Training framework; Weights allocations; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Defect inspection remains challenging due to the low level of automation in some manufacturing plants and the difficulty in identifying defects. To improve the automation and intelligence levels of defect inspection, a CNN model is proposed for the high-precision defect inspection of USB components in the actual demands of factories. First, the defect inspection system was built, and a dataset named USB-SG, which contained five types of defects—dents, scratches, spots, stains, and normal—was established. The pixel-level defect ground-truth annotations were manually marked. This paper puts forward a CNN model for solving the problem of defect inspection tasks, and three strategies are proposed to improve the model’s performance. The proposed model is built based on the lightweight SqueezeNet network, and a rich feature extraction block is designed to capture semantic and detailed information. Residual-based progressive feature integration is proposed to fuse the extracted features, which can reduce the difficulty of model fine-tuning and improve the generalization ability. Finally, a multi-step deep supervision scheme is proposed to supervise the feature integration process.

A new intelligent fault diagnosis method of rolling bearing with small samples is proposed based on structural similarity generative adversarial network (SSGAN) and improved MobileNetv3 convolutional neural network (IMCNN). Firstly, the wavelet transform (WT) is performed on the signal to obtain a wavelet 2D image with time–frequency characteristics. Then, SSGAN is constructed to obtain high-quality generated samples for expanding the small training sets. Finally, the improved MobileNetv3 convolutional neural network (IMCNN) is proposed to extract feature information of the extended samples by using the self-focus mechanism instead of the original lightweight focus mechanism, and the classification results are acquired for fault recognition. The experimental results show that the proposed SSGAN-IMCNN method can effectively extend the small samples and automatically detect the rolling bearing faults with high classification accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Improved MobileNetv3 convolutional neural networks (IMCNN); Intelligent fault diagnosis; Rolling bearings; Small samples; Structurally similar generative adversarial networks (SSGAN)","Classification (of information); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Roller bearings; Wavelet transforms; Convolutional neural network; Diagnosis faults; Fault diagnosis method; Focus mechanism; Improved mobilenetv3 convolutional neural network; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Rolling bearings; Small samples; Structurally similar generative adversarial network; Vibration signal; Generative adversarial networks","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The inefficient operation results in unnecessary energy waste and increased occupant thermal dissatisfaction in homes. In the last two decades, automated fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) methods have served to identify potential faults and provide essential information for repairs and fault-tolerant control strategies. However, the selection of FDD methods largely relies on the system characteristics and available sensor data. Thus, it is challenging for researchers and practitioners to select and apply existing FDD methods for residential VCC systems. This paper presents a comparative analysis of several FDD methods for residential VCC systems, including statistical rule-based charts, sensitivity ratio method, and simple rule-based method, under the same testing conditions. First, a comprehensive collection of FDD approaches for residential VCC systems is introduced with detailed descriptions of required measurements, size of data sets, selected features for identification, essential assumptions, target systems, etc. These FDD methods, compiled in Python, are compared through testing with the same lab test data from a heat pump operating in the cooling season. The performance of these FDD methods is then ranked in terms of diagnosis accuracy, false alarm rate, and sensors requirement. The preliminary test results show that applying these existing FDD methods in specific cases is challenging due to the data unavailability and inherent assumptions (e.g., some threshold values). The diagnosis accuracy for fault-free cases is found to be as high as 100%, i.e., the false alarm rate is relatively low, while the diagnosis accuracy for faulty cases is relatively low if several parameters, like classification thresholds, are set as default assumptions instead of being adapted to the specific scenario. By presenting a comparative analysis of rule-based FDD methods for residential VCC systems, this paper aims to establish a criterion for selecting which features need to be measured in a given fault scenario for different FDD methods in a cost-effective way. © 2022 ASHRAE.","","Alarm systems; Cooling systems; Cost effectiveness; Errors; Failure analysis; Housing; Image resolution; Python; Comparative analyzes; Cycle systems; Detection methods; Diagnostic methods; Energy wastes; False alarm rate; Fault detection and diagnostics; Rule based; Thermal; Vapour compression cycles; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

By this, a high-quality manufacturing test can be performed, giving a certain level of confidence that no defects have occurred during the manufacturing process, which potentially tamper with the functional behavior's correctness. However, a high-quality test implies large test data volume and high test application time, yielding high test costs. This effect is even more amplified when testing ICs for safety-critical applications like automotive systems or avionics, enforcing a zero-defect policy. Analogously, specific structures for the Design for Debug and Diagnosis are introduced since similar problems exist when debugging complex systems. Finally, the Design for Reliability is becoming increasingly important in applications like avionics since the introduced system has typically to deal with harsh environmental conditions and, hence, the IC has to exhibit a specific level of robustness to withstand. This paper proposes novel contributions to, in the end, pave the way for the next generation of IC, which can be successfully and reliably integrated even in safety-critical applications. In particular, this paper combines formal techniques, such as the Boolean satisfiability problem and bounded model checking, to propose (I) a novel test access mechanism with embedded compression including an optimization-based retargeting framework, (II) a new hybrid compression architecture to address compression aborts and (II) an effective fault detection mechanism for single transient faults. The proposed measures are evaluated by considering industrial-relevant benchmark candidates, demonstrating their effectiveness and showing that state-of-the-art techniques are outperformed.  © 2022 IEEE.","bounded-model-checking; compression-aborts; embedded-compression; pseudo-Boolean-Optimization; reliability; SAT-Solver; TAP-Controller; transient-fault","Avionics; Defects; Fault detection; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuits; Model checking; Reliability; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Bounded model checking; Compression-abort; Design for debug; Design for reliability; Design-for-testability; Embedded compression; Pseudo-Boolean optimization; SAT-solv; TAP-controller; Transient faults; Program debugging","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Online condition monitoring technology for the reciprocating compressor is almost mature, whereas the fault diagnosis technologies are still insufficient to meet the need. Therefore, in this paper, a novel fault detection method for the reciprocating compressor based on digital image processing and artificial neural network (ANN) was proposed. This method is implemented to the sectionalized pressure–volume (p–V) curves, which are obtained by dividing a working cycle in the cylinder into four thermal processes, including expansion, suction, compression and discharge. Hit‐or‐miss transform is adopted to extract the comprehensive gradients of expansion and compression curves, and vertical projection transform is applied to extract the vertical projection features. Finally, all of the features are fed to an ANN to do classification. To validate the proposed method, a seeded fault testing was conducted to collect real running data. The results showed that the new approach shows a good performance, with a high classification accuracy of 97.9%. © 2022 by the authors.

However, traditional CNN models usually use single-scale kernels to extract features, which ignores the multiscale features of input data. This article develops a novel residual neural network named multiscale feature fusion deep residual networks for fault diagnosis of aerostat. The designed multiscale feature fusion block (MFF Block) realizes automatic extraction, fusion and compression of multiscale features. The series connection of multiple MFF Blocks makes the proposed model able to extract deeper and wider features from raw signal segments. Then a multiscale pooling layer is developed to extract the most effective features for accurate fault diagnosis. The proposed model is evaluated on an exclusive aerostat strain signal dataset. The comparison results illustrate that the proposed model achieves superior diagnostic performance than several popular models.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.","convolutional neural network; Deep learning; fault diagnosis; feature fusion; residual learning","Aerodynamics; Airships; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Fault detection; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Features fusions; Input datas; Model-based OPC; Multi-scale features; Neural network model; Neural-networks; Residual learning; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Mechanized harvesting in the first season of ratoon rice needs to finish harvesting, threshing, cleaning, straw treatment, grain transportation, grain collection and other processes at one time with a low rolling rate and low rolling degree. Limited by the production conditions such as wet and soft fields, and wet, thick and strong straw, harvest technology with high efficiency and a low rolling rate of ratoon rice in the first season has become the key technology and research focus affecting the yield of ratoon rice.

Majority of the works reported in the literature do not extend the diagnosis of the root cause of the fault for simultaneous faults specifically in the distillation column. However, an industrial system is susceptible to more than one fault at a time, which may or may not be interrelated. These faults not only reduce the diagnosis performance but also increase the computational complexity of the diagnosis algorithm. In this work, therefore, a multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) algorithm is proposed to diagnose simultaneous faults in the distillation column. In the developed MK-SVM algorithm, multilabel approach based on various kernel functions has been utilized for the classification of simultaneous faults. Dynamic simulation of a pilot-scale distillation column using Aspen Plus® is used for generating data in normal and faulty operation. Eight different fault types are considered, including valve sticking at reflux and reboiler, tray upsets, loss of feed flow, feed composition, and feed temperature changes. In the classification of simultaneous faults, a combination of two, three, and four faults is introduced for the performance evaluation of the proposed MK-SVM algorithm. The result showed that the proposed MK-SVM has a high fault detection rate (FDR) of 99.51% and a very low misclassification rate (MR) of 0.49%. The MK-SVM–based classification is better with the F1 score of >97% for all combinations of faults.

The motivation for proposing the novel method is to address the problems of large network size and high training cost in deep learning. First, DTW-KMedoids is adopted to cluster the channels of multi-channel signals. Second, based on the principles of blueprint separable convolution (BSConv) and mixed depthwise convolution (MixConv), a lightweight convolution model construction strategy called clustered blueprint separable convolution (CBS-Conv) is proposed, which uses the same blueprint to convolute the data of the channels in a cluster. Third, CBS-CNN is established, with multiple branches to process data from different clusters, and the computational result of each branch is connected by the proposed Connect layer. Finally, by virtue of the learned features from training, the model completes the end-to-end HST bogie fault diagnosis task, where the usefulness of CBS-CNN in detecting bogie failures including component performance degradation, component failures, and composite failures is validated. Further experiments show that CBS-CNN has a remarkable ability to adapt itself to different task environments and objectives. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bogie; CNN; Fault diagnosis; High-speed train; Lightweight network","Blueprints; Bogies (railroad rolling stock); Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electric circuit breakers; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Channel signals; Clustering methods; CNN; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; High speed trains; High-precision; K-medoids; Lightweight network; Multi channel; article; convolutional neural network; deep learning; diagnosis; dynamic time warping; human; motivation; velocity; Railroads","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Unidentified faults can have a negative impact on the availability, performance and maintenance costs of heat pump systems. This study provides a description of faults related to the operation of 53 heat pumps based on a vapour compression cycle. Faults were characterized according to potential causes, mitigation or prevention implications as well as detection and diagnosis methods. Faults in the compressor, evaporator and source heat exchanger were more recurrent than in other components of large-scale heat pumps. Overall, the most common faults were fouling of heat exchangers and refrigerant leakage. Faults related to negative impacts like system shutdown, performance reduction and release of refrigerant into the environment, were mainly described to be originated in the compressor. Several directions for future research were identified, which included developing specific fault detection and diagnosis methods for large-scale heat pump applications, proposing methods to detect and diagnose multiple and simultaneous faults, and integrating performance degradation monitoring with fault detection and diagnosis. © 2022","District heating; Fault detection; Fault diagnosis; Heat pump; Process heating","Failure analysis; Fault detection; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Refrigerants; Availability costs; Common faults; Decarbonisation; District heating system; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; Heat pumps; Industrial processs; Large-scales; System process; District heating","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In order to meet the speed and recognition accuracy requirements of bearing fault diagnosis, this paper uses the lightweight MobileNetV2 network combined with fast spectral kurtosis to diagnose bearing faults. On the basis of the original MobileNetV2 network, a progressive classifier is used to compress the feature information layer by layer with the network structure to achieve high-precision and rapid identification and classification. A cross-local connection structure is added to the network to increase the extracted feature information to improve accuracy. At the same time, the original fault signal of the bearing is a one-dimensional vibration signal, and the signal contains a large number of non-Gaussian noise and accidental shock defects. In order to extract fault features more efficiently, this paper uses the fast spectral kurtosis algorithm to process the signal, extract the center frequency of the original signal, and calculate the spectral kurtosis value. The kurtosis map generated by signal preprocessing is used as the input of the MobileNetV2 network for fault classification. In order to verify the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, this paper uses the XJTU-SY bearing fault dataset and the CWRU bearing dataset to conduct experiments. Through data preprocessing methods, such as data expansion for different fault types in the original dataset, input data that meet the experimental requirements are generated and fault diagnosis experiments are carried out. At the same time, through the comparison with other typical classification networks, the paper proves that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of accuracy, model size, training speed, etc., and, finally, proves the effectiveness and generality of the proposed network model in the field of fault diagnosis. © 2022 by the authors.","classifier structure; cross local connection; fast kurtogram; fault diagnosis; lightweight network","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, most deep learning technologies currently adopted only use a single network stack or a certain network stack with multilayer perceptron (MLP) behind it. Compared with traditional fault diagnosis technologies, this method has made progress in both the diagnosis accuracy and speed, but due to the limited performance of a single network, the accuracy or speed cannot meet the requirements to the greatest extent. In order to overcome such problems, this article proposes a fault diagnosis method using deep learning multimodel fusion. Different from previous deep learning diagnosis methods, this method uses long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features separately. The extracted features are then fused and MLP is taken as the input for further feature compression and extraction, and finally the diagnosis results will be obtained. LSTM has long-term memory capabilities, the extracted features have temporal characteristics, and CNNs have a good effect on the extraction of spatial features. The proposed method integrates these two aspects for diagnosis such that the features finally extracted by the network have both spatial and temporal characteristics, thereby improving the network's diagnostic performance. Finally, a TE chemical process and an industrial coking furnace process are taken for simulation testing. It is proved that the performance of this method is superior to existing deep learning fault diagnosis methods with simple sequential stacking for unilateral feature extraction.  © 2013 IEEE.","Chemical processes; convolutional neural network (CNN); deep learning; fault diagnosis; long short-term memory (LSTM)","Chemical Phenomena; Deep Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Convolutional neural networks; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Multilayer neural networks; Diagnostic performance; Fault diagnosis method; Fault diagnosis technology; Feature compression; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Learning technology; Multi layer perceptron; Temporal characteristics; chemical phenomena; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Lightweight diagnosis networks are the core of this technology. However, existing lightweight diagnosis networks have the following limitations: 1) they lack a lightweight learning mechanism for edge computing scenarios to deal with time-scale changes of bearing fault features when trains operate under variational conditions and 2) an adaptive neural network pruning technique synchronized with training is expected to avoid the repetitive and cumbersome processes of traditional pruning techniques. To overcome the above limitations, this article proposes a new multiscale lightweight network with adaptive pruning for the intelligent diagnosis fault of train bogie bearings in edge computing scenarios. First, weight-sharing multiscale convolutions (WSMSCs) are developed to capture multi-time scale features from vibration signals with extremely low computing costs. Then, inverse separable convolution (ISC) blocks are built to further capture high-level features, and an adaptive pruning technique that does not require artificial jobs is proposed to eliminate useless network structures concurrently with training. Finally, diagnostic results are obtained through a dense layer activated by Softmax. Experimental results demonstrate that the accuracy and complexity of the proposed network are superior to other state-of-the-art lightweight bearing fault diagnosis networks under varying operating conditions. Furthermore, the proposed networks can be deployed on more general edge devices.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bearing fault diagnosis; deep learning; edge computing; multiscale convolution; neural network pruning","Bogies (railroad rolling stock); Deep learning; Edge computing; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Real time systems; Variational techniques; Bearing fault diagnosis; Deep learning; Edge computing; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Multi-scale convolution; Multi-scales; Network pruning; Neural network pruning; Neural-networks; Pruning techniques; Convolution","Article","Final","","Scopus"

On the other hand, real-time monitoring produces large amounts of data, leading to significant challenges for efficient and effective data transmission (from the shop floor to the cloud) and analysis (in the cloud). Restricted by industrial hardware capability, especially Internet bandwidth, most solutions approach data transmission from the perspective of data compression (before transmission, at local computing devices) coupled with data reconstruction (after transmission, in the cloud). However, existing data compression techniques may not adapt to domain-specific characteristics of data, and hence have limitations in addressing high compression ratios where full restoration of signal details is important for revealing machine conditions. This study integrates Deep Convolutional Autoencoders (DCAE) with local structure and physics-informed loss terms that incorporate PHM domain knowledge such as the importance of frequency content for machine fault diagnosis. Furthermore, Fault Division Autoencoder Multiplexing (FDAM) is proposed to mitigate the negative effects of multiple disjoint operating conditions on reconstruction fidelity. The proposed methods are evaluated on two case studies, and autocorrelation-based noise analysis provides insight into the relative performance across machine health and operating conditions. Results indicate that physically-informed DCAE compression outperforms prevalent data compression approaches, such as compressed sensing, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and DCAE with a standard loss function. FDAM can further improve the data reconstruction quality for certain machine conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Big data; Data compression; Physics-informed deep learning; Prognostics and health management","Condition monitoring; Data communication systems; Data compression; Data transfer; Deep learning; Discrete cosine transforms; Discrete wavelet transforms; Floors; Health; Information management; Principal component analysis; Signal reconstruction; Systems engineering; Auto encoders; Condition; Data reconstruction; Data-transmission; Operating condition; Physic-informed deep learning; Prognostic and health management; Shopfloors; Signal compression; Signals reconstruction; Big data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Recent deep learning-based methods have been applied for FD and have obtained excellent performance. However, most of them require sufficient historical labeled data to train the model which is difficult and sometimes not available. Moreover, the big size model increases the difficulties for real-time FD. Therefore, this article proposed a domain adaptive and lightweight framework for FD based on a one-dimension convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). Particularly, 1D-CNN is designed with a structure of autoencoder to extract the rich, robust hidden features with less noise from source and target data. The extracted features are processed by correlation alignment (CORAL) to minimize domain shifts. Thus, the proposed method could learn robust and domain-invariance features from raw signals without any historical labeled target domain data for FD. We designed, trained, and tested the proposed method on CRWU bearing data sets. The sufficient comparative analysis confirmed its effectiveness for FD. © 2022 by the authors.

For the fault signal, the compressed sensing (CS) technology is used to perform noise reduction and feature extraction. The noise reduction process consists of sparse compression and reconstruction of the signal. After the data is processed by the compressed sensing technology, the noise and redundant parts of the signal can be greatly removed, and the real operating state signal of the wind turbine can be restored to the maximum. The fault diagnosis scheme is based on a combination of deep transfer learning and convolutional neural network (DTL-CNN), which is able to perform fault type identification with a small batch of rolling bearing data samples and gear samples. In this study, a new CNN structure was developed and the structure was used to achieve bearing-to-bearing and bearing-to-gear transfer fault diagnosis.

At the same time, a reasonable explanation for an intelligent diagnosis model based on features is currently lacking. Therefore, we exploit an explainable one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) model by combining with the demodulated frequency features of vibration signals and apply it to the fault classification of rolling bearings under time-varying speed conditions. First, the speed signals obtained by the speed encoder were transformed into generalized demodulation operator (GDO). Second, combined with the sensitive frequency band and GDO, the generalized demodulation algorithm was used to extract the frequency features from the amplitude envelope of the vibration signal. Subsequently, the proposed lightweight 1DCNN was trained to classify the frequency features and identify the health states of the rolling bearing. Finally, the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations model was utilized to explain the proposed model based on the features which own weight. It is found that the internal classification mechanism of the lightweight 1DCNN is realized according to the distribution of fault features, which is consistent with the process of human brain analysis. Two kinds of time-varying speed datasets which come from the University of Ottawa and XJTU are tested and verified. The results show that compared with other intelligent fault diagnosis methods, the identification error of the proposed method is lower and the diagnosis stability is better. The average diagnostic accuracy was 96.26% and 99.82%, respectively.  © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","1DCNN; fault diagnosis; LIME; rolling bearing; time-varying speed","Demodulation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Lime; Optical variables measurement; Roller bearings; 1DCNN; Faults diagnosis; Frequency features; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Model-based OPC; Rolling bearings; Time varying; Time-varying speed; Varying speed conditions; Vibration signal; Speed","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Concurrent failures are so common and hidden in complex systems that diagnosis requires not only analysis of failure characteristics, but also correlation between failures. Therefore, in this paper, a concurrent fault diagnosis method is proposed for power equipment based on graph neural networks and knowledge graphs. First, an electrical equipment failure knowledge map is created based on operational and maintenance records to emphasize the relevance of the failed equipment or component. Next, a lightweight graph neural network model is built to detect concurrent faults in the graph data. Finally, a city’s transformer concurrent fault is taken as an example for simulation and validation.

Here, for the first time, we propose an artificial neural network for interface defect detection and identification of triboelectric nanogenerators via training voltage waveforms. First, interface defects of TENGs are classified and their causes are discussed in detail. Then we build a lightweight artificial neural network model which shows high sensitivity to voltage waveforms and low time complexity. The model takes 2.1 s for training one epoch, and the recognition rate of defect detection is 98.9% after 100 epochs. Meanwhile, the model successfully demonstrates the learning ability for low-resolution samples (100 × 75 pixels), which can identify six types of TENG defects, such as edge fracture, adhesion, and abnormal vibration, with a high recognition rate of 93.6%.

However, most of the existing rolling bearing fault diagnosis models have complex structures, need a large number of samples, and cannot fully use the information contained in the signal. Based on these problems, an intelligent method for detecting and identifying rolling bearing faults is proposed based on an improved two-stream compression convolution network. The proposed method has a compact structure and powerful feature extraction capability, which consists of two modules. One adopts depthwise separable convolution and squeeze and excitation network, named DSCSE, which can fully extract the spatial features and greatly reduce the number of parameters. The other utilizes a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and spatial dropout mechanism, named 1DCNNSD, which can efficiently extract the temporal features and reduce model complexity. Meanwhile, to reduce the loss of information contained in the signal when the linear rectification unit is under negative input, the improved ReLU is designed.

However, most schemes require a great deal of labeled data and many iterations for training parameters. They suffer from low accuracy and over fitting under the few-shot scenario. In addition, a large number of parameters in the model consumes high computing resources, which is far from practical. In this paper, a multi-scale and lightweight Siamese network architecture is proposed for the fault diagnosis with few samples. The architecture proposed contains two main modules. The first part implements the feature vector extraction of sample pairs. It is composed of two lightweight convolutional networks with shared weights symmetrically. Multi-scale convolutional kernels and dimensionality reduction are used in these two symmetric networks to improve feature extraction and reduce the total number of model parameters. The second part takes charge of calculating the similarity of two feature vectors to achieve fault classification. The proposed network is validated by multiple datasets with different loads and speeds. The results show that the model has better accuracy, fewer model parameters and a scale compared to the baseline approach through our experiments. Furthermore, the model is also proven to have good generalization capability. © 2022 by the authors.

Compact models with high accuracy that can be embedded in handheld devices are in high demand. This research proposes a novel method for bearing fault diagnosis based on vibration signals using a low-computation-cost deep learning model. Generally, the vibration signal collected from the bearing of the electrical motor is transformed into the spectrogram images by Constant-Q nonstationary Gabor transform, in which these images are used as the training data.

Compared with the traditional single-source transfer approach, the multisource transfer approach has shown its advantages and gradually become a research hotspot. However, most existing multisource transfer methods mainly focus on the elimination of domain distribution discrepancies and neglect the resulting degradation of diagnostic performance. In addition, more common scenarios (especially in cross-working condition diagnostics), namely the absence of domain labels and the presence of category shifts, are not considered, which leads to severe limitations in the application of existing methods. To this end, this paper proposes an instance adaptative multisource transfer approach. It improves the model's learning ability through instance-adapted feature extraction and training guidance. Specifically, an input-dependent dynamic feature encoder is elaborated to achieve statistically adapting domains by adapting instances, thereby mitigating domain conflicts and lifting the constraints that require domain labels. Furthermore, considering the adverse influence of negative instances on model adaptation, the instance distillation and weighted training strategy is designed to address it and tackle the category shift problem. Experimental results of extensive cross-domain diagnosis tasks built on two datasets and comparison with multiple state-of-the-art methods validate the proposed method's effectiveness and superiority. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Domain adaptation; Fault transfer diagnosis; Instance adaptive; Rotating machinery","Distillation; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Knowledge management; Condition; Cross-domain; Domain adaptation; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Fault transfer; Fault transfer diagnose; Instance adaptive; Knowledge transfer; Multi-Sources; Transfer strategies; Rotating machinery","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The superior performance of DNN-based fault diagnosis methods is attributed to the deepening network structure, which increases the complexity of the deep models and causes difficulties to deploy them in industrial environments with constrained resources. To address the problems, this paper proposes a multi-hierarchical compression to compact the deep neural network for intelligent fault diagnosis. It combines network pruning, parameter quantization, and matrix compression to process the deep model from different perspectives, which achieves a considerable reduction of parameter volume and acceleration of training and response. Firstly, structured pruning is employed to prune the inconsequential filters in the convolutional layer, and unstructured pruning is utilized to eliminate the trivial connections in the fully connected layer. Then, parameter quantization is applied to minimize the number of bits that are required for parameter representation. Finally, the matrix compression storage is taken advantage of to reduce the requirements of storage capacity and further alleviate the excessive demands for the monitoring system. Experimental results and comparisons on two bearing datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

To develop a strategy for refrigerant charge fault of the above system, the optimization methods have been implemented to predict the refrigerant charge level (RCL) based on virtual refrigerant charge (VRC) models. Firstly, Pearson correlation coefficient analysis is employed to obtain the characteristic parameters. Secondly, a piecewise modified VRC model with the different characteristic parameters from VRC models is obtained for two cases of RCL < 75% and RCL > 75%. Meanwhile, combined with the principal component analysis (PCA) and the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, a PCA-SVM model is developed to improve the prediction accuracy, and the average root mean squared error (RMSE) is only 7.8 compared to 14.9 of the modified VRC model when RCL > 75%, meanwhile, the correctly detected ratio is improved from 62.8% to 84.5%. Then, for solving the difficulty of fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) when RCL > 160%, the moving time window average (MA) algorithm is introduced and an online PCA-MA-SVM model is developed.

The usual approach to data compression is to collect data first, then compress it; however, we cannot ensure the correctness and efficiency of the data. Based on sparse Bayesian optimization block learning, this research provides a method for compression reconstruction and fault diagnostics of diesel engine vibration data. This method’s essential contribution is combining compressive sensing technology with fault diagnosis. To achieve a better diagnosis effect, we can effectively improve the wireless transmission efficiency of the vibration signal. First, the dictionary is dynamically updated by learning the dictionary using singular value decomposition to produce the ideal sparse form. Second, a block sparse Bayesian learning boundary optimization approach is utilized to recover structured non-sparse signals rapidly. A detailed assessment index of the data compression effect is created. Finally, the experimental findings reveal that the approach provided in this study outperforms standard compression methods in terms of compression efficiency and accuracy and its ability to produce the desired fault diagnostic effect, proving the usefulness of the proposed method. © 2022 by the authors.

Recently, deep learning (DL) is widely used for accurate diagnosis, which automatically extracts useful features instead of relying on experts. For real-time diagnosis, in an emerging edge computing paradigm, massive data generated by end-device are processed in nearby edge nodes, which reduces energy consumption and latency. However, large amounts of data are required for model training in the cloud, which leads to tremendous burdens of transmission and computation. To tackle these issues, a data-driven diagnosis method based on compressed sensing (CS) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for open-circuit faults of PV inverters. Based on CS, raw signals are compressed in edge nodes with the optimal compression ratio determined by experiments. The proposed CS-CNN is evaluated on an edge-cloud semi-physical experiment platform. Compared with common compression methods, the accuracy of CS is improved by more than 3%, and the time consumption is only one-fifth. Compared with the CNN of the same structure, the transmission and computation time is largely reduced by an order of magnitude. The developed CS-CNN compresses 85% of data with a test accuracy of 99.18%. © 2022 The Authors.

With the gradual complication of modern industrial machinery and equipment, it has become more difficult for traditional feature extractors to achieve the desired results. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have been developed as effective techniques for fault classification but require large-scale high-intensity computing and prohibitive hardware resource requirements. This paper proposes a lightweight CNN that can be easily used for the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery by adjusting the network structure and optimizing the network. First, the raw vibration acceleration signal is transformed into a two-dimensional gray image. Second, two mature and commonly used modules named LeNet and NIN are combined to form a new model with a simple structure. Then, through parameter adjustment and optimization, an improved and optimized CNN with a lightweight structure and fewer parameters is constructed. The experimental verification has shown that this method has high accuracy and stability in fault diagnosis. Finally, the application of this new network for the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings with different damage levels but similar fault types shows high diagnostic accuracy and good generalization ability. In addition, we attempt to explain how the feature filters of a CNN work by visualizing the convolutional layer of the network. © IMechE 2020.","convolutional neural network; Intelligent fault diagnosis; lightweight network structure; parameter optimization; rotating machinery","Convolution; Deep neural networks; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Network layers; Roller bearings; Rotating machinery; Experimental verification; Fault diagnosis method; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Generalization ability; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Parameter adjustments; Two dimensional gray image; Vibration acceleration; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","","Scopus"

It is very suitable for the current and future aerospace equipment manufacturing needs of increasing integration, complexity, lightweight and integration of structure and function, and provides a great opportunity for the transformation and upgrading of traditional aerospace manufacturing industry. In recent years, the laser additive manufacturing (LAM) technology with metal powder as raw material and laser as heat source has become one of the most popular research directions in the field of additive manufacturing technology. Its application range in the aerospace field has gradually developed from the part level to the whole machine level, and is moving towards industrialization and intellectualization. Based on this, aiming at three types of typical light and high-strength metal materials (i.e., aluminum alloys, titanium alloys and Ni-based superalloys) and three types of typical structures (i.e., large integral structure, heterogeneous metal structure and whole engine structure) widely used in the aerospace field, this paper reviewed current internal and international development situation of LAM technology in recent years and its application progress in the aerospace field, analyzed the existing problems and deficiencies and provided new prospects on the potential research and development direction of LAM technology in the future. This paper firstly summarized the research and application status and development direction of LAM of aluminum alloys, titanium alloys and Ni-based superalloys, and then reviewed the progress and challenge of LAM of three typical aerospace structures, namely large integral structure, heterogeneous metal structure and whole engine structure. Finally, the key problems to be solved in the engineering application and development of LAM technology in aerospace field in the future were pointed out and the future development direction was prospected. Aerospace industry was one of the main forces to promote the development and application of additive manufacturing technology. In this paper, the development and application progress of LAM technology of three types of typical light and high-strength metal materials in recent years had been reviewed. It could be predicted that the development trend of LAM technology was to move towards industrialization and intellectualization, and realize the integration of material, structure, process, performance/function. In order to accelerate the industrialization and intellectualization development of additive manufacturing and support the construction of China's aerospace power, the authors suggested that there were still the following key problems to be studied and solved in the engineering application and development of LAM technology in the aerospace field. Firstly, due to the lack of time for the research and development of additive manufacturing technology, the research on design, materials and processes was not deep enough, and mature and reliable design methods, rich material systems, detailed process database and efficient post-processing technologies were lacking, and these were not enough to support the rapid industrial application and development needs of additive manufacturing in aerospace field. The technical research for the whole process of additive manufacturing needed to be further strengthened. Secondly, at present, the research and application of LAM technology were still focused on the traditional alloys. The traditional alloys composition designed based on the equilibrium solidification process theory was difficult to meet the non-equilibrium physical metallurgy characteristics of LAM, which led to the common problems of LAM, such as high crack sensitivity, poor toughness and fatigue performance, and serious anisotropy. Thus, it was urgent to improve the material design theory, develop and establish a special material system library based on the characteristics of LAM. Thirdly, there was a lack of technical means for the design, preparation and forming of multiphase materials/multi-materials, multi-scale innovative structures, and this put forward revolutionary requirements for the equipment and process of AM. Thus, the research and development of innovative AM technologies and equipment such as multi-material printing, macro/micro multi-scale structure printing, multi-process integration and coordination printing must be accelerated. Fourthly, there was a lack of simulation and monitoring technology and method of LAM process for the whole process of full-scale component level forming. On the one hand, at present, the calculation equivalent of the numerical simulation physical model of AM was generally at the weld bead level. It was urgent to develop a cross-scale multi physical field numerical simulation algorithm and calculation model for the full-scale component level forming process that took into account the calculation efficiency and accuracy. On the other hand, at this stage, the intelligent degree of AM equipment was not high. There were many problems, such as less feedback information from the monitoring system, unable to optimize the process parameters in real time, and low maturity of intelligent diagnosis and processing. Thus, it was urgent to develop an intelligent AM system and equipment integrating synchronous on-line monitoring of multiple metallurgical features and intelligent fault diagnosis and processing. Finally, at present, LAM technology in the aerospace field was in rapid development, but the development of the supporting technical standards was relatively lagging behind, and the construction of the standard system could not keep up with the development of engineering applications, which seriously restricts the technical standardization and industrial development. There was an urgent need to form perfect specifications and standards for the detection and evaluation of special materials, processes, equipment and products. © 2022, Youke Publishing Co., Ltd.

To further improve sample efficiency, this paper proposes semi-supervised multitask deep convolutional generative adversarial network (SM-DCGAN). One-dimensional raw vibration signals are transformed into two-dimensional grayscale images. Different from traditional DCGAN, the proposed SM-DCGAN fuses the tasks of discrimination and classification to form multitask discriminator, which can simultaneously train labeled and unlabeled samples. Subsequently, knowledge distillation method is used to achieve simple fault classifier from multitask discriminator. Then, unbalanced samples can be expanded by generator in SM-DCGAN. Unlabeled samples, labeled samples and expanded samples are input into the simple fault classifier to realize semi-supervised fault diagnosis. The results of rolling bearing fault diagnosis experiments fully prove that the proposed SM-DCGAN has high accuracy, great robustness and sufficient stability for unbalanced fault samples. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Deep convolutional generative adversarial network; Knowledge distillation; Rolling bearing; Semi-supervised, multitask discriminator; Unbalanced fault diagnosis","Convolution; Discriminators; Distillation; Fault detection; Generative adversarial networks; Roller bearings; Deep convolutional generative adversarial network; Fault sample; Faults diagnosis; Knowledge distillation; Rolling bearings; Semi-supervised; Semi-supervised, multitask discriminator; Unbalanced fault; Unbalanced fault diagnose; Unlabeled samples; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In recent years, various of methods based on the deep learning method have made the great progress in the field of the mechanical fault diagnosis. However, there is a conflict between the massive parameters of the fault diagnosis networks and the limited computing resource of the embedded platforms. It is difficult to deploy the trained network on the small scale embedded platforms (like field programmable gate array (FPGA)) in the actual industrial situations. This seriously hinders the practical process of the intelligent fault diagnosis method. To address this problem, a new neural network compression method based on knowledge-distillation (K-D) and parameter quantization is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, a large scale deep neural network with multiple convolutional layers and fully-connected layers is designed and trained as the teacher network. Then a small scale network with just one convolutional layer and one fully-connected layer is designed as the student network. When training the student network, the K-D process is conducted to improve the accuracy of the student network. After the training process, the parameter quantization is conducted to further compress the scale of the student network. Experimental results on the field programmable gate array (FPGA) are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can greatly compress the scales of the fault diagnosis networks for over 10 times at the cost of the minimal loss of the accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Bearing fault diagnosis; Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Knowledge-distillation; Neural network compression method; Parameter quantization","Bearings (machine parts); Condition monitoring; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Distillation; Fault detection; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Logic gates; Multilayer neural networks; Students; Bearing fault diagnosis; Compression methods; Field programmable gate array; Field programmables; Knowledge-distillation; Network compression; Neural network compression method; Neural-networks; Parameter quantization; Programmable gate array; Quantisation; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, along with this comes the challenge of reconstructing the original signal from the compressed signal with high quality and efficient manner. To circumvent the tedious reconstruction process, this paper proposed a fault diagnosis method based on compressed domain feature identification. Within the basic framework of compressed sensing, the well-known Gaussian random measurement matrix was replaced by a row ladder observation matrix to achieve compressed measurement of the original signal. Aiming at the interference of random noise on the compressed observation signal, a weak fault feature extraction method based on maximum correlation kurtosis deconvolution (MCKD) and 1.5-dimensional spectrum was established. In which the periodic shock component in the compressed signal was enhanced by MCKD to eliminate the interference of transmission path and background noise, and the 1.5-dimensional envelope spectrum was subsequently used to extract the fault feature frequency. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method not only circumvents the complex reconstruction process needed by classical compression sensing, but also achieves accurate fault diagnosis results under conditions of strong noise interference. © 2022, Editorial Department of Journal of Beijing University of Technology.

Realising the challenge of developing a facile and straightforward model that resolves these problems, this study proposed the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) based on frequency-domain signal processing. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is initially utilised to transform the signals from the time domain to the frequency domain; the data was represented using a phasor notation, which separates magnitude and phase and then fed to the 1D-CNN. Subsequently, the model is trained with White Gaussian Noise (WGN) to improve its robustness and resilience to noise. Based on the findings, the proposed model successfully achieved 100% classification accuracy from clean signals and simultaneously achieved considerable robustness to noise and exceptional domain adaptation ability. The diagnosis accuracy retained up to 97.37%, which was higher than the accuracy of the CNN without training under noisy conditions at only 43.75%. Furthermore, the model achieved an accuracy of up to 98.1% under different working conditions, which was superior to other reported models. In addition, the proposed model outperformed the state-of-art methods as the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) was lowered to −10 dB achieving 97.37% accuracy. In short, the proposed 1D-CNN model is a promising effective rolling bearing fault diagnosis. © 2022 by the authors.","bearing; deep learning; fast Fourier transform; fault diagnosis; one-dimensional convolutional neural network; signal-to-noise ratio","Algorithms; Fourier Analysis; Neural Networks, Computer; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Fast Fourier transforms; Fault detection; Frequency domain analysis; Gaussian noise (electronic); Roller bearings; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Time domain analysis; Bearing; Bearing fault diagnosis; Convolution neural network; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Environmental noise; Faults diagnosis; Frequency domains; One-dimensional; One-dimensional convolutional neural network; algorithm; Fourier analysis; signal noise ratio; signal processing; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

IMS uses the Internet of Things (IoT) platform for handling data as well as Interoperability and Communication among the devices and components in the IMS. Moreover, IMS includes a personal cloud server for computing and storing the acquired data of PV systems. The IMS also consists of a web monitor system via some open-source and lightweight software that displays the information to multiple users. The IMS uses deep ensemble models for fault detection and power prediction in PV systems. A remarkable ability of the IMS is the prediction of the output power of the PV system to increase energy yield and identify malfunctions in PV plants. To this end, a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble neural network is developed to predict the output power of PV systems under different environmental conditions. On the other hand, the IMS uses machine learning-based models to detect numerous faults in PV systems. The fault diagnostic of IMS is based on the following stages. Firstly, major features are elicited through an analysis of Current–Voltage (I–V) characteristic curve under different faulty and normal events. Second, an ensemble learning model including Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used for detecting and classifying fault events. To enhance the performance in the process of fault detection, a feature selection algorithm is also applied. A PV system has been designed and implemented for testing and validating the IMS under real conditions. IMS is an interoperable, scalable, and replicable solution for holistic monitoring of PV plant from data acquisition, storing, pre-and post-processing to malfunction and failure diagnosis, performance and energy yield assessment, and output power prediction. © 2022 by the authors.

However, along with the continuous improvement in diagnostic accuracy, the number of parameters in the network is increasing and the models can often only be run in servers with high computing power. Embedded devices are widely used in on-site monitoring and fault diagnosis. However, due to the limitation of hardware resources, it is difficult to effectively deploy complex models trained by deep learning, which limits the application of deep learning methods in engineering practice. To address this problem, this article carries out research on network lightweight and performance optimization based on the MobileNet network. The network structure is modified to make it directly suitable for one-dimensional signal processing. The wavelet convolution is introduced into the convolution structure to enhance the feature extraction ability and robustness of the model. The excessive number of network parameters is a challenge for the deployment of networks and also for the running performance problems. This article analyzes the influence of the full connection layer size on the total network. A network parameter reduction method is proposed based on GAP to reduce the network parameters. Experiments on gears and bearings show that the proposed method can achieve more than 97% classification accuracy under the strong noise interference of −6 dB, showing good anti-noise performance. In terms of performance, the network proposed in this article has only one-tenth of the number of parameters and one-third of the running time of standard networks. The method proposed in this article provides a good reference for the deployment of deep learning intelligent diagnosis methods in embedded node systems. © 2022 by the authors.

Among these approaches, the spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) approach has been widely used and studied due to its lightweight and high effectiveness. However, while the existence of coincidental correct (CC) test cases can influence the usefulness of SBFL in single-fault programs, their influence on multiple fault programs has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, in this article, we conduct a theoretical analysis and an empirical study to investigate the effect of CC test cases on multiple fault localization. The theoretical analysis is based on a suspiciousness calculation formula of SBFL, which divides CC test cases into three categories (specific, irrelevant, and unspecific) according to their association with a specific faulty statement. Following this analysis, we conduct an empirical study on two well-known open-source repositories (SIR and Defects4J), and the experimental results verify the correctness of our theoretical analysis. Specifically, reducing the number of specific CC test cases for a faulty statement can improve or maintain fault localization accuracy, while eliminating irrelevant CC test cases can have a negative effect. Finally, we design a CC test case identification solution based on the isolation-based multiple fault localization approach and demonstrate its effectiveness via a simulation experiment.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Coincidental correct test case; empirical study; fault localization; multiple fault; theoretical analysis","Fault detection; Job analysis; Open source software; Software testing; Code; Coincidental correct test case; Computer bugs; Debugging; Empirical studies; Fault localization; Faults diagnosis; Location awareness; Multiple faults; Software; Task analysis; Test case; Theoretical analyse; Program debugging","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Intelligent fault diagnosis technology based on deep learning (DL) has gained increasing attention. A critical challenge is how to embed the characteristics of time series into DL to obtain stable features that correlate with equipment conditions. This study proposes a lightweight rolling bearing fault diagnosis method based on Gramian angular field (GAF) and coordinated attention (CA) to improve rolling bearing recognition performance and diagnosis efficiency. Firstly, the time domain signal is encoded into GAF images after downsampling and segmentation. This method retains the temporal relation of the time series and provides valuable features for DL. Secondly, a lightweight convolution neural network (CNN) model is constructed through depthwise separable convolution, inverse residual block, and linear bottleneck layer to learn advanced features. After that, CA is employed to capture the long-range dependencies and identify the precise position information of the GAF images with nearly no additional computational overhead. The proposed method is tested and evaluated by CWRU bearing dataset and experimental dataset. The results demonstrate that the CNN based on GAF and CA (GAF-CA-CNN) model can effectively reduce the calculation overhead of the model and achieve high diagnostic accuracy. © 2022 by the authors.

However, in most real cases, only few labeled data can be acquired in fault diagnosis tasks, which is far from the essential requirement for training a deep model from scratch. To tackle this problem, a novel two-step fine-tuning process is primarily proposed, based on the idea of implementing information from a relevant auxiliary task via tuning less task-specific weights, which expands the fine-tuning method. A lightweight model is adapted for lower data consumption. Furthermore, a distance loss function is designed and embedded into the training process with a dynamic tuning process for sparser feature representations.

The proposed CSAN model is divided into two components. The first component is a lightweight channel convolution neural network (CCNN) designed to fully utilize channel information and perform feature extraction and classification. The second component is an innovative domain adaptation algorithm that can be used as a loss function embedded in a deep learning network. The embedded domain adaptation loss function consists of two terms. The first is a class-domain loss term, which achieves domain adaptation by measuring the correlation alignment (CORAL) distance between the source domain and target domain in each subdomain divided by category. The second term is a class-margin loss term. Through the idea of maximizing the probability difference, it can not only lessen the unreliability of pseudolabels generated by the network, but also maximize the feature differences among classes to achieve better classification performance. A multitask experiment under changeable working conditions on three public bearing datasets proves the superiority of the proposed CSAN model. Compared with other methods, CSAN can achieve the optimal best performance and has desirable generalization performance, whose value remains near the best-performance value. Hence, CSAN is relatively stable and reliable, proving that it has universal and practical application in bearing fault diagnosis under variable working conditions.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bearing fault diagnosis; subdomain adaptation; unsupervised transfer learning; variable working conditions","Classification (of information); Convolution; Deep learning; Extraction; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Bearing fault diagnosis; Condition; Employee welfare; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Subdomain; Subdomain adaptation; Transfer learning; Unsupervised transfer learning; Variable working condition; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Firstly, the characteristics of two advanced time-frequency analysis algorithms are deeply analyzed, i.e., multisynchrosqueezing transform (MSST) and time-reassigned multisynchrosqueezing transform (TMSST). Then, we propose time-frequency compression fusion (TFCF) and a residual time-frequency mixed attention network (RTFANet). Among them, TFCF superposes and splices two time-frequency images to form dual-channel images, which can fully play the characteristics of multi-channel feature fusion of the convolutional kernel in the convolutional neural network. RTFANet assigns attention weight to the channels, time and frequency of time-frequency images, making the model pay attention to crucial time-frequency information. Meanwhile, the residual connection is introduced in the process of attention weight distribution to reduce the information loss of feature mapping. Experimental results show that the method converges after seven epochs, with a fast convergence rate and a recognition rate of 99.86%. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has better robustness and precision. © 2022 by the authors.

For many industrial applications, AI-based solutions become viable when combined with edge-computing strategies. It means a framework with limited network bandwidth and computational processing power. The developed approach uses a low-delay lightweight recurrent neural network (LLRNN) applied to identify the unbalance of light rotating machinery. Two strategies, Long Short-Term Memory and Just Another NETwork cells, are evaluated to reduce the RNN computational cost. The goal is to allow the RNN to be shipped on devices with low computational processing while preserving excellent prediction accuracy. We also discuss the RNN hyperparameters and other relevant aspects that can improve the accuracy and performance: A metric evaluation is proposed. The main contribution is that it is possible to use fewer memory blocks with one cell each to reduce the computational cost. The fault diagnostics is done in two ways: The results are close to 100% accuracy using mechanical vibration signals and 95% using motor current signature analysis. The unbalance diagnosis using electric current data of light motors with LLRNN is also a contribution. Accurate fault diagnostics with an efficient algorithm either by the vibration or electric current datasets gives more flexibility for smart manufacturing. © 2022, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.","Diagnostics; Edge computing; Recurrent neural network; Rotating machinery; Unbalance","Cost reduction; Edge computing; Flow control; Manufacture; Operating costs; Recurrent neural networks; Vibration analysis; Computational costs; Computational processing; Computing frameworks; Diagnostic; Edge computing; Faults diagnostics; Low delay; Rotating machine; Smart manufacturing; Unbalance; Rotating machinery","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Hence, a lightweight and robust model via feature fusion-based unsupervised adversarial learning (LRFFUAL) is proposed, which could be a special benefit for practical engineering applications. A main innovation lies in a customized feature fusion block to achieve a tradeoff between model lightweight and robustness. Accordingly, a channel residual strategy is proposed to apply residual techniques for channels with weak feature information to achieve data augmentation. Concerning cross-domain tasks with huge distribution discrepancy, a new adversarial learning strategy is proposed to improve model convergence rate by inputting marginal features into a discriminator.

However, the changing operation state of industrial systems will lead to the decline of model performance. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to explore the dynamic update of models. This work establishes an incremental fault diagnosis (IFD) framework, and further proposes a model evolution mechanism based on adaptive knowledge distillation and representative exemplar selection (MEMAR). Firstly, when new samples pour in, knowledge distillation (KD) is used to mine the potential correlation between old and new samples, with adaptive constraints on parameter optimization for model updating. Secondly, genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to selectively retain representative exemplar subsets, so as to enhance the model&#x2019;s ability to deal with dynamic data. Moreover, in order to further verify the effectiveness of MEMAR, the discrimination performance of the fault diagnosis model after multi-stage incremental learning is tested. The experimental results show that the proposed MEMAR can reduce the storage space of old samples and training time. Besides, it enables the fault diagnosis model based on deep learning to have excellent diagnostic performance for new and old samples.

This method is based on the frequency band selection scheme of CS and particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Firstly, the method uses CS technology to compress and sample the bearing AE signal to obtain the compressed signal; then, the compressed AE signals are decomposed by the compression domain wavelet packet decomposition matrix to extract the characteristic parameters of different frequency bands, and then the weighted sum of the characteristic parameters is carried out. At the same time, the PSO method is used to optimize the weight coefficient to obtain the enhanced fault characteristics; finally, a feature-enhanced-support vector machine (SVM) fault diagnosis model is established. Different feature parameters are feature-enhanced to form a feature set, which is used as input, and the SVM method is used for pattern recognition of different types and degrees of bearing faults. The experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively extract the fault features in the bearing AE signal while improving the efficiency of signal processing and analysis and realize the accurate classification of bearing faults. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

The two main limitations of existing domain-adaptation-based fault diagnosis methods for RBs are as follows. One is that the source domain transfer fault features contain a large amount of redundant information interfering with domain adaptation. The other is that discrepancies in the distribution between the same class fault samples under different working conditions lead to low transfer diagnosis accuracy. Aiming at overcoming these two limitations, in this study, a cross-domain transfer fault diagnosis model based on Wasserstein adversarial channel compression variational autoencoder (WACCVAE) is proposed. First, fault features are channel-compressed to reduce the interference of redundant features with domain adaptation; an improved variational autoencoder network with a channel compression of fault features - WACCVAE - is proposed. Secondly, the classification module function adopts an inter-class-intra-class distance constraint to improve the distribution alignment ability of same class fault samples for different working conditions. Overall, WACCVAE can accomplish the task of cross-condition transfer fault diagnosis in RBs. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","different working conditions; inter-class intra-class distance constraints; transfer fault diagnosis; variational autoencoder","Failure analysis; Learning systems; Roller bearings; Channel compression; Domain adaptation; Domain transfers; Existing domains; Fault diagnosis method; Intelligent diagnosis; Redundant features; Rolling bearings; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The main idea of fault diagnosis based on JADE-SAE proposed in this paper is as follows: firstly, the signal at the measurement point of the switch converter is compressed and preprocessed using compression sensing. In the compressed domain, the high-dimensional time-domain characteristic parameters of each measurement point's signal are extracted and JADE dimension reduction fusion is carried out. These parameters are used in training the SAE network; thus, an improved network structure is established. Finally, the essential characteristics of the circuit fault are mined, and the softmax classifier is used for fault diagnosis.

When defective, sensors either stop communicating or convey incorrect information. These unsteady situations threaten the safety, economy, and reliability of a system. The objective of this study is to construct a lightweight machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostic system within the limited energy resources, memory, and computation of aWireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper, a Context- Aware Fault Diagnostic (CAFD) scheme is proposed based on an ensemble learning algorithm called Extra-Trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a realistic WSN scenario composed of humidity and temperature sensor observations is replicated with extreme low-intensity faults. Six commonly occurring types of sensor fault are considered: drift, hard-over/bias, spike, erratic/precision degradation, stuck, and data-loss. The proposed CAFD scheme reveals the ability to accurately detect and diagnose low-intensity sensor faults in a timely manner. Moreover, the efficiency of the Extra-Trees algorithm in terms of diagnostic accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and training time is demonstrated by comparison with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms: a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network. © 2021 by the authors.

However, this reduction will only be possible if the equipment is maintained correctly. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) systems can improve the cost of operating and maintaining heating and air conditioning systems, specifically heat pump, while keeping their performance. This article first briefly introduces the methodologies used in FDD systems for heat pumps and compare their performance. Then, an accurate description of the common faults and their effects on field vapor compression systems is made. After that, a compilation of which faults and how are emulated in both laboratory conditions and virtual environments are extensively described. The measurements needed to perform the diagnosis are analyzed along with instrumentation needed for FDD systems. Finally, the virtual sensors applied to heat pumps to reduce the cost associated with FDD implementation are described. This article aims to establish a criterion for selecting which faults can be tested under laboratory conditions or by simulation with a virtual model and to determine the features that identify those faults. Finally, several areas of improvement for the aspects reviewed have been identified: increase the use of performance indicators for FDD, new and updated studies about the health status of field heat pumps, testing methods that take into account the gradual and probabilistic nature of heat pump faults and further research in the use of virtual sensors in FDD systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Fault detection and diagnosis; FDD; Heat pumps; Vapor compression cycle; Virtual sensors","Air conditioning; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Testing; Detection and diagnosis; Domestic buildings; Fault detection and diagnosis systems; Heating-and-air conditioning system; Laboratory conditions; Performance indicators; Vapor-compression systems; Virtual modeling; Fault detection","Review","Final","","Scopus"

The application of the failure modes of analog circuits shows that the proposed ULSAM method can realize the pattern classification of analog circuit faults more quickly and accurately. © 2021 IEEE.","Analog circuit; Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; Pattern recognition","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Timing circuits; Attention mechanisms; Circuit failures; Classification accuracy; Classification methods; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fault recognition; Faults diagnosis; Neural network feature extractions; Ultra lightweights; Analog circuits","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

However, the limited bandwidth and battery energy of WSNs will impede the high-speed data collection and transmission required in the machine fault diagnosis system. To address this challenge, this article proposes a novel machine fault diagnosis method based on separable convolution and WSNs with sensor computing. First, a lightweight 1-D separable convolution network fault diagnosis model is designed and embedded on the WSNs sensor node. Machine fault diagnosis is then completed on the sensor node, and only the diagnosis result is transmitted in the WSNs to reduce transmission data. A set of experiments have been conducted on the experimental setup to evaluate the proposed method. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed method can reach 98.3%, and the payload transmission data of the WSN decrease from 2048 bytes to 2 bytes, while the node's energy consumption saves about 15%. Compared with traditional 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN) and 1-D residual network (ResNet), the proposed method is more suitable for the application on resource-constrained WSNs nodes.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; Internet of Things (IoT); sensor computing; separable convolutions; wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Convolution; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Internet of things; Neural networks; One dimensional; Sensor nodes; Computational modelling; Convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; IoT; Machine fault diagnosis; Payload; Sensor computing; Separable convolution; Vibration; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, imbalanced training data pose a negative effect on the fault diagnosis algorithms based on the data driven. When the data are extremely imbalanced, this problem becomes more challenging. Furthermore, to reduce the deployment cost, in industrial practice, it is often required that the parameters and computation of the deployed diagnosis model should be within a certain range, which puts forward the requirement of lightweight for diagnosis model. Therefore, in this article, a novel lightweight framework for fault diagnosis with extremely imbalanced data, called HS-KDNet, is proposed. Soft labels generated by knowledge distillation can represent the similarity between categories, i.e., through to learn the soft labels, the information about all categories are considered in each update of the parameters, not only the information about the current samples. Consequently, unlike traditional data re-balancing strategies based on generating pseudo samples, we utilized knowledge distillation to suppress the adverse effects of imbalanced data for the first time. On two classical bearing datasets, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed HS-KDNet were demonstrated, and the experimental results shown that, except for HS-KDNet, knowledge distillation can significantly inhibit the adverse effects of imbalanced data on other simple models. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs); fault diagnosis; imbalanced data; knowledge distillation; lightweight network","Balancing; Cost engineering; Distillation; Distilleries; Failure analysis; Balancing strategy; Current samples; Deployment costs; Diagnosis algorithms; Diagnosis model; Imbalanced data; Industrial practices; Lightweight frameworks; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, the amplitude underestimation caused by different penalty functions reduces the precision of extracted fault features. To handle this difficulty, a reweighted overlapping group shrinkage (R-OGS) method for bearing fault diagnosis is proposed in this article. The group property of the fault signal and the amplitude underestimation problem are considered simultaneously. A novel group weighting coefficient based on the l2 -norm of the group is designed to mitigate the amplitude compression caused by the group penalty. Although a nonconvex penalty function is used to improve the performance, the cost function can be convex with appropriate parameter selection. The convexity condition is given and the solution algorithm is derived based on the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. The setting strategy of the group size and the regularization parameter is given after in-depth analysis. The numerical simulation shows that the R-OGS method has stronger amplitude retention of fault feature signal and noise suppression capability than previous overlapping group shrinkage (OGS). The bearing fault experiment signals verify that the proposed R-OGS method has superior performance in fault feature extraction compared to the Moreau-enhanced total variation denoising (MTVD) and the fast kurtogram (FSK). © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bearing fault diagnosis; majorization-minimization (MM); nonconvex regularization; reweighted overlapping group shrinkage (R-OGS)","Cost functions; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Numerical methods; Bearing fault diagnosis; Majorization-minimization; Minimisation; Nonconvex; Nonconvex regularization; Overlapping groups; Penalty function; Regularisation; Reweighted overlapping group shrinkage; Shrinkage methods; Shrinkage","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Original equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings, the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, severely impeding vehicle-related research, including CAN cybersecurity and privacy studies, aftermarket tuning, efficiency and performance monitoring, and fault diagnosis to name a few. Guided by the four-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder), a modular, four-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit and length), endianness (byte ordering), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards, augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with meaningful, physical interpretation. En route to CAN-D, we provide a comprehensive review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. All previous methods ignore endianness and signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing dependencies. In response, we formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte orderings. In addition, we provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers - both of which are superior to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios - and the first signedness classification algorithm, which exhibits a > 97% F-score. Overall, CAN-D is the only solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal that is also the state of the art. In evaluation on 10 vehicles of different makes, CAN-D's average $\ell ^1$ error is five times better (81% less) than all previous methods and exhibits lower average error, even when considering only signals that meet prior methods' assumptions. Finally, CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware, allowing for an on-board diagnostic (OBD-II) plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Controller area network (CAN); machine learning; privacy; reverse engineering; security; technology","Automobile manufacture; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Decoding; Mapping; Pipelines; Privacy by design; Process control; Reverse engineering; Vehicles; Classification algorithm; Controller area network; Efficiency and performance; Optimization problems; Original equipment manufacturers; Physical interpretation; Precision and recall; Real-time communication; Signal processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is the core part of inverters and the root source of PV inverter failures. How to effectively diagnose the IGBT faults is critical for reliability, high efficiency, and safety of PV systems. Recently, deep learning (DL) methods are widely used for fault detection and diagnosis. Different from traditional diagnosis methods, DL methods use deep neural networks which can automatically extract the useful representative features from raw data. However, DL methods require large amounts of data, which leads to the high cost of communication, storage, and computation. To tackle these issues, a data-driven fault detection and diagnosis method for IGBT open-circuit faults based on compressed sensing (CS) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) is proposed in this paper. CS is adopted to compress raw signals, and the optimal value of compression ratio (CR) is determined by considering the trade-off between classification accuracy and model training time. The overlap sampling method is adopted for data segmentation. Meanwhile, overlap sampling can also increase the number of training samples and improve the sample correlation. The compressed signals are segmented and reconstructed into two-dimensional feature maps for model training. Finally, compared with CNN of the same structure, the developed CS-CNN model can compress 85% of data without accuracy loss. The performance comparison with the state-of-the-art networks demonstrates that the test accuracy is 98.68% and the model training time is much shorter than other methods. © 2021 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; Deep learning; Fault detection and diagnosis; IGBT open-circuit fault; Photovoltaic system","Compressed sensing; Deep neural networks; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Electric inverters; Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT); Signal reconstruction; Solar panels; Timing circuits; Compressed-Sensing; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fault detection and diagnosis; Insulated gate bipolar transistor open-circuit fault; Insulatedgate bipolar transistor (IGBTs); Learning methods; Model training; Open-circuit fault; Photovoltaic systems; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Especially, the test dataset is consisting of multiple speeds while the training dataset only consists of one speed which is different from the speeds measured in the test dataset. To solve such a problem, a method based on the One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) is proposed for bearing fault diagnosis in this paper. The proposed method can learn features of different scales by convolution kernels of different sizes directly from one-dimensional vibration signals and avoid the loss of fault-related information caused by manual signal processing. Moreover, the 1D-CNN is more lightweight than a Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) in fault diagnosis. The proposed method is verified on two bearing datasets and compared with some the-state-of-the-art methods. The results show that 1D-CNN can achieve higher accuracy with less time consumption for partial domain fault diagnosis of bearings under cross-operating conditions. © 2022 IEEE.","1D-CNN; Bearings; cross-speed conditions; fault diagnosis; partial domain","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Fault detection; Signal processing; Speed; Statistical tests; 1d-CNN; Bearing; Condition; Convolutional neural network; Cross-speed condition; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Faults diagnosis; One-dimensional; Operating condition; Partial domain; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Nonetheless, due to the safety considerations, complex environment, and limitation of deployment cost in actual industrial production, the algorithms used for fault diagnosis often face the three challenges of limited samples, noise interference, and lightweight, which is an impediment in the fault diagnosis practice of transformer with high requirements for number of samples and parameters. For this reason, this article proposes a lightweight transformer based on convolutional embedding and linear self-attention (LSA), called CLFormer. By modifying the embedding module and the form of self-attention, the aim of lightweight is realized (MFLOPs: 0.12; Params: 4.88 K) under the condition of boosting high-accuracy of transformer. The effectiveness was demonstrated on Self-Made dataset with four comparative models, especially when each type of training sample is 6× 4, the CLFormer achieves the highest average accuracy of 83.58% when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is from-8 to 8 dB for three types of noise. As the first attempt to use transformer for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, this work provides a feasible strategy for the research topic of fault diagnosis with the goal of practical deployment. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Anti-noise; Convolutional neural networks; Fault diagnosis; Lightweight; Limited sample","Accident prevention; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Embeddings; Fault detection; Machinery; Signal to noise ratio; Antinoise; Convolutional neural network; Embeddings; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Lightweight; Limited sample; Transformer; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Traditional fault diagnosis methods are not suitable for edge-side fault diagnosis because they have high storage and calculation requirements. According to the characteristics of edge-side fault diagnosis, a new method of edge-side fault diagnosis based on lightweight neural network model is proposed in this paper. The method uses knowledge distillation technology to extract fault diagnosis knowledge from convolutional neural network used for fault diagnosis, which is sample soft label. Then a small neural network for fault diagnosis is trained with soft label.

SCADA collects, processes and displays the electric parameters recorded by the end components at the control panels. In case of malfunctions, SCADA neither distinguishes between faults, attacks and maintenance events nor identifies their type or location of occurrence.A distinction between them would avoid component damage and power system blackout caused due to resulting fault current. Hence, there is a need to develop efficient models to classify between faults, attacks and maintenance events based on the type and location of occurrence. In this work, we propose classification models to enable speedy attack detection and distinguish between faults and attacks using machine learning algorithms. We compute the classification accuracy, energy consumed and execution time of the algorithms to analyze the trade-offs in choosing between lightweight and accurate models. While, k-NN, SVM and Naive Bayes classify the faults with lower accuracy and energy, algorithms such as OneR, Adaboost and JRip are more accurate and incur higher energy consumption. Further, we classify the faults and attacks based on the type and location of occurrence, sequence currents and phase voltage constraints. Evaluation of proposed approach using cyber-attack datasets on Industrial Control System (ICS) shows that the models classify between faults and attacks with 97.25% accuracy. In addition, depending on the type and location of occurrence, faults, attacks and load variations observed during normal operation have been classified with accuracies of 96.55%, 97.22% and 98.98% respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Attack classification; Common electric faults; Lightweight algorithms; Power relays; SCADA","Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Cybersecurity; Economic and social effects; Electric power systems; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Nearest neighbor search; SCADA systems; Support vector machines; Attack classifications; Common electric fault; Energy; Faults attacks; Lightweight algorithm; Load variations; Power relays; Power station; Power systems application; Supervisory control and data acquisition; Location","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

First, the centrifugal pump vibration signatures are fast transformed using a Walsh transform, and Walsh spectra are obtained. To overcome the hefty noise produced by macro-structural vibration, the proposed method selects the fault characteristic coefficients of the Walsh spectrum. In the second stage, statistical features in the time and Walsh spectrum domain are extracted from the selected fault characteristic coefficients of the Walsh transform. These extracted raw statistical features result in a hybrid high-dimensional space. Not all these extracted features help illustrate the condition of the centrifugal pump. To overcome this issue, novel cosine linear discriminant analysis is introduced in the third stage. Cosine linear discriminant analysis is a dimensionality reduction technique which selects similar interclass features and adds them to the illustrative feature pool, which contains key discriminant features that represent the condition of the centrifugal pump. To achieve maximum between-class separation, linear discriminant analysis is then applied to the illustrative feature pool. This combination of illustrative feature pool creation and linear discriminant analysis forms the proposed application of cosine linear discriminant analysis. The reduced discriminant feature set obtained from cosine linear discriminant analysis is then given as an input to the K-nearest neighbor classifier for classification. The classification results obtained from the proposed method outperform the previously presented state-of-the-art methods in terms of fault classification accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE.","Centrifugal pump; cosine linear discriminant analysis; fault diagnosis; walsh transform","Discriminant analysis; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Nearest neighbor search; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Walsh transforms; Cosine linear discriminant analyse; Fault characteristics; Faults diagnosis; Features extraction; Linear discriminant analyze; Principal-component analysis; Vibration; Walsh spectrum; Principal component analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The partial least squares algorithm is a multivariate statistical method, compared with the principal component analysis, its compression factor score contains more original data characteristic information, therefore, partial least squares have greater potential for fault diagnosis than the principal component analysis. However, there are few studies based on partial least squares in the field of HVAC. In order to introduce partial least squares into the field, based on the partial least squares fault detection theory, a fault analysis method suitable for this field is proposed, and the RP1403 data published by ASHARE was used to verify this method. The results show that on the basis of selecting the appropriate number of principal components, partial least squares have the ability to diagnose the fault of the chiller sensor. With the known fault source, partial least squares regression, a method with better data reconstruction accuracy than principal component analysis, is used to repair the fault.

Early detection and identification of the sensor node's abnormality are critical to ensure the SIL-IoTs system's reliability. In this study, we propose a lightweight separable 1D convolution neural network that can be implemented in SIL-IoTs nodes to identify sensor faults, reduce detecting delay, and decrease data transmission. However, the reliability of data acquired by sensors is decreased because a SIL-IoTs node releases high voltage pulse discharge (a kind of electromagnetic interference) when pests collide with its metal mesh. This kind of data fluctuation impacts fault diagnosis accuracy. Consequently, fault-related feature maps and temporal signals are characterized via a novel time and channel attention module (TCAM) method, which contributes to separating electromagnetic interference noise from sensor faults of SIL-IoTs nodes. A real-world testbed is applied to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on sensor fault diagnosis in the SIL-IoTs system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect four typical sensor faults with the best trade-off between accuracy (99.9% average accuracy and 97.6% average F1-score) and efficiency (351 KB inference model size and 4.33 W average energy consumption on Raspberry Pi).  © 2020 IEEE.","attention mechanism; depthwise separable convolution; Sensor fault diagnosis; solar insecticidal lamp internet of things","Convolution; Economic and social effects; Electric discharges; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic wave interference; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Internet of things; Logic gates; Sensor nodes; Signal interference; Detection and identifications; Discharge (electric); Electromagnetics; Fault diagnosis method; Faults diagnosis; High voltage techniques; Lightweight sensors; Sensor fault diagnosis; Sensors faults; System reliability; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, once a variety of transformer failure occurs, it will not only reduce the reliability of the power system but also cause major accidents and huge economic losses. Until now, many diagnosis methods have been proposed to monitor the operation of the transformer. Most of these methods cannot be detected and diagnosed online and are prone to noise interference and high maintenance cost that will cause obstacles to the real-time monitoring system of the transformer. This paper presents a full-time online fault monitoring system for cast-resin transformer and proposes an overheating fault diagnosis method based on infrared thermography (IRT) images. First, the normal and fault IRT images of the cast-resin transformer are collected by the proposed thermal camera monitoring system. Next is the model training for the Wasserstein Autoencoder Reconstruction (WAR) model and the Differential Image Classification (DIC) model. The differential image can be acquired by the calculation of pixel-wise absolute difference between real images and regenerated images. Finally, in the test phase, the well-trained WAR and DIC models are connected in series to form a module for fault diagnosis. Compared with the existing deep learning algorithms, the experimental results demonstrate the great advantages of the proposed model, which can obtain the comprehensive performance with lightweight, small storage size, rapid inference time and adequate diagnostic accuracy. © 2021 by the authors.

The relevant information of latent variables is selected by the probability of assigning the effect to the slab component, while the influence of the non-informative ones is eliminated by the spike component. Furthermore, a Bayesian inference scheme based on the expectation-maximization framework is developed for the parameter learning procedure of the model.

With numerous Internet of things (IoT) sensors being installed on motors for condition monitoring, data transmission and storage problems have become new challenges. This study designed a signal enhancement and compression (SEC) method and implemented on an IoT platform for motor bearing fault diagnosis. First, vibration signal is acquired from an accelerometer installed on the motor. The bearing signal is demodulated using an online demodulation algorithm. Second, an envelope signal is downsampled and enhanced using a stochastic resonance-based nonlinear filter. The enhanced signal is compressed using an Opus encoder and transmitted to a receiver. Lastly, the received signal is decompressed using the Opus decoder, and the bearing fault type can be recognized. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SEC method are verified on an IoT platform compared with a conventional method. The proposed method improves 3.83 dB of the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and reduces 94.7% of the total time and 94.6% of the dissipative power. The advantages of the proposed SEC method include high output SNR, low power consumption, and compatibility with edge computing. These advantages show potential applications in remote motor fault diagnosis using battery power supply. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","edge computing; fault diagnosis; IoT; Motor bearing; signal enhancement and compression","Condition monitoring; Digital storage; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Green computing; Magnetic resonance; Signal receivers; Signal to noise ratio; Stochastic systems; Compression methods; Conventional methods; Demodulation algorithms; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Internet of Things (IOT); Low-power consumption; Signal enhancement; Stochastic resonances; Internet of things","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this case, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) method for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which can largely satisfy the need of less parameter amount and storage space as well as high accuracy. First, light-weight convolution blocks are constructed through basic elements such as spatial separable convolutions with the aim to effectively reduce model parameters. Secondly, the LCNN model for the intelligent fault diagnosis is constructed via lightweight convolution blocks instead of the tradi-tional convolution operation. Finally, to address the “black box” problem, the entire network is visualized through Tensorboard and t-distribution stochastic neighbor embedding. The results demonstrate that when the number of lightweight convolutional blocks reaches 6, the diagnosis accuracy of the LCNN model exceeds 99.9%. And the proposed model has become the most robust with parameters significantly decreasing. Furthermore, the proposed LCNN model has realized accurate, automatic, and robust fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, which makes it more suitable for deployment under the IIoT context. © 2021 Yan et al.","","Humans; Intelligence; Internet of Things; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer; Stochastic Processes; Vibration; Wavelet Analysis; article; convolutional neural network; diagnostic accuracy; embedding; human; internet of things; stochastic model; intelligence; Markov chain; theoretical model; vibration; wavelet analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The signals generated by machines are mostly periodic due to the rotating nature of its components. Often, these vibrations witness strong interactions among two or multiple rotating sources, leading to modulation phenomena. This paper is specifically concerned with the CS of this particular class of signals using a Bayesian approach. The main contribution of this paper is to consider the particular spectral structure of these signals through two families of hierarchical models. The first one adopts a block-sparse model that jointly estimates the sparse coefficients at identical or symmetrical positions around the carrier frequencies. The second is a spike-and-slab model where the spike component takes into account the symmetrical properties of the support of non-zero-coefficients in the spectrum. The resulting posterior distribution is approximated using a Gibbs sampler. Simulations show that considering the structure in the prior model yields better noise shrinkage and better reconstruction of small side-bands. Application to condition monitoring of a gearbox through CS of vibration signals highlights the good performance of the proposed models in reconstructing the signal, offering an accurate fault detection with relatively high compression rate.

In this paper, we propose a closed-loop system based on domain adaption to inspect the tightness of the generator's slot wedge. To detect the fault pattern of a given sample, a feature extraction algorithm using frequency spectrum analysis is introduced. Also, a basic spectrum is designed to eliminate potential disturbances in the frequency domain.

In order to reduce the redundancy in the periodic data more effectively, the method used a two-dimensional grayscale representation of the original one-dimensional data according to the cycle of opening and closing the door once to form a two-dimensional grayscale image. The grayscale image was adaptively partitioned, and the wavelet threshold amplification factor of each block was automatically adjusted through preset thresholds and compression ratios. Finally, the data were compressed using a two-dimensional wavelet. Taking the test data in a subway depot in a certain place in Jiangsu Province as an example, different subway plug door status data were used for actual measurement. The results show that when the signal to noise ratio is 43 dB and the mean square error is about 0.7%, a compression ratio of 1.5% can be achieved. In the face of waveforms with large amplitude changes, the algorithm used in this work can retain enough detailed information for areas with small amplitudes while ensuring the compression rate, which verifies the feasibility and stability of the algorithm. © 2021, Central South University Press.

To overcome the deficiency of traditional methods, such as low recognition accuracy, slow diagnosis speed, and relying on manual extraction of features, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on inverted residual convolutional neural network embedded with squeeze-and-excitation block (SE-IRCNN) is proposed. This method adopts a lightweight concept to reduce the calculation amount significantly. The body of the model is built with inverted residual blocks to reduce the feature loss in the dimensional reduction. Squeeze-and-excitation block is embedded to recalibrate the features.

Insulators are numerous and widely distributed in transmission lines. They operate in the field for a long time. Affected by high voltage and complex climate, faults, such as defects and cracks, occur easily. Faults have serious consequences and entail economic losses. Therefore, the insulator components in aerial images need to be identified efficiently and accurately to provide a basis for fault diagnosis and other related work. Traditional insulator recognition methods include threshold segmentation based on target features and recognition algorithms based on image enhancement. These methods need features to be designed manually, but manual selection of labeled features is prone to errors or false checks, and the recognition efficiency and accuracy are low. Hence, this approach cannot fully meet actual needs. Compared with traditional methods, such as image segmentation and image enhancement, deep learning extracts insulator features automatically by using a machine, and it is more accurate and faster than manual extraction. Researchers have used the popular algorithm faster region convolutional neural network(Faster RCNN) to identify insulators and generated proposal regions in the last feature layer by convolution to identify insulator targets. This algorithm results in an insufficient number of feature maps to be identified, and the small scale leads to weak semantic information of insulators, which easily causes misdetection and even non-detection. When the single-shot multi-box detector and ""you only look once"" use a fixed-size convolution kernel to identify insulators with a large scale difference, the semantic information of insulator features with a relatively small scale is reduced, which easily causes small-scale insulation misdetection. Method: An insulator recognition model based on the improved scale-transferrable network is proposed to address the problems that traditional methods cannot automatically extract insulator features and that the deep learning network is insufficient to extract insulator semantic information. This model meets the requirements of automatic recognition and semantic information enhancement. The length and width of the insulator images are limited to 300 × 300 pixels. The preprocessed insulator images are outputted to the backbone network Densenet-169. Densenet-169 completes the feature extraction of the insulator images. The improvement work in this study is mainly divided into three parts. First, the feature integration method is used to enhance the semantic information of the feature map generated by Densenet-169. Second, after feature extraction, the semantic information loss of the small-scale insulator becomes serious; therefore, the small-scale feature map in the network is expanded to further enrich the semantic information. Lastly, the parameters of the anchor box are improved to effectively identify the insulator with a large-scale difference. After the improvement work is completed, the accurate position information of the insulator is obtained through bounding box regression, and the insulator is identified. Result: The experimental data set is composed of composite, glass, and ceramic insulators. The images have a total of 4 350, which include 2 000 composite, 1 350 glass, and 1 000 ceramic insulator images. The scale of each image is preprocessed as 300 × 300 pixels, and the training and test sets are divided randomly(3 250 and 1 100, respectively). Experimental results show that the model structure is improved, and the recognition accuracy is 96.28%. The improvement in recognition accuracy ranges from 1.98% to 11.99% relative to the traditional Faster RCNN, improved Faster RCNN, and improved region-based fully convolutional neural network(R-FCN). Conclusion: The improved model increases the accuracy of insulator identification significantly and lays a solid foundation for subsequent transmission line detection work. Considering that the total number of anchor boxes is increased due to the improved scaling module, the compression parameters will be considered in future work to reduce the calculation. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Image and Graphics.

To implement the fault-tolerant capabilities, a four-leg inverter is used to drive the reference PMSM, so that a system reconfiguration can be applied in case of a motor phase fault or an inverter fault, by enabling the control of the central point of the three-phase con-nection. A crucial design point is to develop Fault-Detection and Isolation (FDI) algorithms capable of minimizing the system failure transients, which are typically characterized by high-amplitude high-frequency torque ripples. The proposed FTC is composed of two sections: in the first, a deterministic model-based FDI algorithm is used, based the evaluation of the current phasor trajectory in the Clarke’s plane; in the second, a novel technique for fault accommodation is implemented by applying a reference frame transformation to post-fault commands. The FTC effectiveness is as-sessed via detailed nonlinear simulation (including sensors errors, digital signal processing, mechanical transmission compliance, propeller loads and electrical faults model), by characterizing the FDI latency and the post-fault system performances when open circuit faults are injected. Compared with reports in the literature, the proposed FTC demonstrates relevant potentialities: the FDI section of the algorithm provides the smallest ratio between latency and monitoring samples per electrical period, while the accommodation section succeeds in both eliminating post-fault torque ripples and maintaining the mechanical power output with negligible efficiency degradation. © 2021 by the authors.

It was proposed in this work a discussion about the identification of the fault criticality condition in each load category in an internal combustion engine through the use of a neuron map. Measurements were made under the following load conditions: no load (0 Kw), 0.5 Kw, 1.0 Kw and 1.5 Kw, through insertion in standard condition (without failure), and in conditions with failures of the following types: wear on the valve stem exhaust, clearance between the valve guide and the stem of the exhaust valve and radial wear of the compression segment ring. A neural fault map was generated for each load condition, using clustering data mining tools using the Wards method, artificial neural networks using the Kohonen method and Confusion Matrix prediction matrix. The results showed that, in the standard condition (without load) and with 0.5 kW of load, the highest level of criticality was related to the clearance between the valve guide of the exhaust valve stem.

In this study, an intelligent fault diagnosis method is developed based on the probabilistic knowledge distillation (PKD) and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the health states of bearings. First, the one-dimensional vibration signal is reshaped as a two-dimensional matrix to input the teacher or student network. Then, a deeper neural network and small network are trained as the teacher and student networks, respectively. The probability distribution (PD) is learned by minimizing the difference of the joint density probability estimation between the teacher and student networks, that is, the lightweight network learns to integrate the PD of the deeper neural network in the high-dimensional feature space and realizes the knowledge transfer from training samples to test samples. The results of experimental bearings indicate that the proposed diagnosis method has higher diagnosis accuracy than the other two popular knowledge distillation methods and its student network only has about one 700-th parameter of the teacher network. Therefore, the proposed method achieves a good balance between the classification accuracy and network compression, and demonstrates potential application to intelligent fault diagnosis of bearings under varying working conditions. © 2021 IEEE.","Bearing.; Deep learning; Fault diagnosis; Neural network compression; Probabilistic knowledge distillation","Deep neural networks; Distillation; Fault detection; Knowledge management; Probability distributions; Students; Bearing.; Deep learning; Faults diagnosis; Network compression; Neural network compression; Neural-networks; Probabilistic knowledge; Probabilistic knowledge distillation; Student network; Teachers'; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

These classifiers are quick and maintain a low computational load that are suitable for the automotive environment where only low-performance Electronic Control Units (ECUs) are available. However, these classifiers do not produce sufficiently accurate results when raw sensor data is used as the input. To solve this issue, we have developed an approach that firstly includes sensor data selection, where only sensors that have a strong impact on accuracy are used as input.

This research proposes variational mode decomposition (VMD)-DenseNet to diagnose faults in bearings. The research feature involves analyzing the Hilbert spectrum through VMD whereby the vibration signal is converted into an image. Healthy and various faults show different characteristics on the image, thus there is no need to select features. Coupled with the lightweight network, DenseNet, for image classification and prediction. DenseNet is used to build a model of motor fault diagnosis; its structure is simple, and the calculation speed is fast. The method of using DenseNet for image feature learning can perform feature extraction on each image block of the image, providing full play to the advantages of deep learning to obtain accurate results. This research method is verified by the data of the time-varying bearing experimental device at the University of Ottawa. Through the four links of signal acquisition, feature extraction, fault identification, and prediction, a mechanical intelligent fault diagnosis system has established the state of bearing. The experimental results show that the method can accurately identify four common motor faults, with a VMD-DenseNet prediction accuracy rate of 92%.

In order to solve the problems about computation bottleneck of the pointwise convolution module which is widely used in lightweight networks, and explore how to effectively evaluate the quality of extracted features as well as deeply merge traditional fault diagnosis methods into deep learning, this paper proposed a diagnosis model named butterfly-transform (BFT)-MobileNet V3. BFT-MobileNet V3 was based on MobileNet V3, and consisted of BFT module and a novel algorithm called Deep-SHAP. This model not only had the advantages of low time complexity and high accuracy compared with the original network, but also had a novel feature that was able to automatically figure out the fault characteristic frequency and visualize the quality of extracted features. The experimental results showed that the time complexity of the BFT-MobileNet V3 model proposed in this paper decreases from O(n2) to O (nlogn) while keeping a high accuracy rate. With the same time complexity, BFT-MobileNet V3 also had a higher accuracy rate than other networks. Meanwhile, with the Deep SHAP algorithm, the proposed model can accurately calculate the fault feature frequency of the roller bearings as well as intuitively visualize the quality of extracted features.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","deep learning; fault diagnosis; fault-characteristic frequency extraction; lightweight network","Complex networks; Deep learning; Fault detection; Roller bearings; Accuracy rate; Characteristic-frequency; Deep learning; Fault characteristics; Fault-characteristic frequency extraction; Faults diagnosis; Frequency extraction; High-accuracy; Lightweight network; Time complexity; Failure analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this study, a method for data compression and restoration of transient operation parameters of nuclear power plants is established by improving the characteristic engineering algorithm. The method uses principal component analysis to extract the feature vector of transient operation parameters, and combined with the Gaussian process regression method, the reduced dimension transient operation data can be restored with high precision. The results show that, after the transient operation data are compressed and restored, the maximum error between the restored and actual values does not exceed 0.000 002. The compressed data characteristics can also provide a basis for the judgment of fault diagnosis of nuclear power plants and further improve the safety and reliability of nuclear power plants.

At present, most successful fitting detectors are anchor-based, which are challenging to meet the requirements of edge deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-free method called HRM-CenterNet. Firstly, the lightweight MobileNetV3 is introduced into CenterNet to extract multi-scale features of different layers. In addition, the lightweight receptive field enhancement module is proposed for the deep layer features to further enhance the characterization power of global features and generate more accurate heatmaps. Finally, the high-resolution feature fusion network with iterative aggregation is designed to reduce the loss of spatial semantic information in subsampling and further improve the accuracy of small and occlusion objects. Experiments are carried out on the TFITS and PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that the size of the network is more than 60% lower than that of CenterNet. Compared with other detectors, our method achieves comparable accuracy with all accurate models at a much faster speed and meets the performance requirements of real-time detection.  © 2022 Huimin He et al.","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This study proposes a new method to implement comprehensive intelligent diagnosis by adopting the ShuffleNet lightweight convolution neural network (SLCNN). Considering the requirements of the UPIoT intelligent terminal, this study constructs six models, which are measured in terms of recognition accuracy, model storage, and calculation cost when applied to insulation and mechanical datasets. Compared with the existing models, the SLCNN outperforms them significantly in terms of recognition accuracy, with an accuracy of 95.77% and 99.9% in insulation and mechanical fault diagnoses, respectively. The SLCNN also demonstrates obvious advantages in other performance indicators, all of which contribute to its use in the accurate and reliable fault diagnosis of power equipment in the UPIoT context. Furthermore, through comparing feature maps, it is discovered that the aliasing degree and boundary of insulation defects are not as obvious as those of mechanical faults, which means that insulation fault diagnosis is much more difficult than mechanical fault diagnosis. © 2020 The Authors.

The FPM can simulate a wide range of situations while the NN corrects the model output using information from the historical data of the process. Operating conditions corresponding to different types of faults were simulated with the HM and saved with their description in a process state library. To detect a fault, the online measured data was compared with that corresponding to the operation under normal conditions. If a significant deviation was detected, the current state was compared with all the states stored in the process state library and it was identified as the one at the shortest distance. The method was tested with real data from a methanol-water industrial distillation column. During the studied period of operation of the plant, two faults were identified and reported. The proposed method was able to identify such failures more effectively than an equivalent model of first principles. The results obtained show that the proposed method has a great potential to be used in the automatic diagnosis of faults in refining and petrochemical processes. © 2020 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","fault detection; first principle model; hybrid model; neural network; process monitoring","Distillation columns; Distilleries; Automatic diagnosis; Automatic fault detection; Equivalent model; Fault detection and diagnosis; First principles; Normal condition; Operating condition; Petrochemical process; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, the gear tooth crack will open under the action of mesh force in the meshing process, the mesh stiffness of the cracked tooth and the dynamic response of gear system is thus different from the closed crack case. There almost no studies have been done to investigate the influence of tooth crack open state on mesh stiffness and dynamic response. Thus, this paper presents an improved mesh stiffness calculation model of the cracked gear, in which the effective compression section and the neutral layer of the cracked tooth are re-evaluated considering the crack opening state. Then, the accuracy of the proposed model is verified by the finite element method (FEM), and the differences of mesh stiffness and statistical indicators of the dynamic response between the proposed and traditional models are further studied. The mesh stiffness calculation results show that the proposed model achieves a higher accuracy than the traditional model. And its precision gradually increases as the crack grows, which can be improved by 2.35% in the case of large crack (48.38% crack) when compared to the traditional model. The fault response signal obtained from the traditional model yields a larger amplitude than the actual situation, which will lead to errors of the statistical indicators used for fault diagnosis, in particular, the RMS value can be up to an average percentage difference of 11.98% under the large crack (48.38% crack). It is concluded that the proposed model has a higher accuracy for calculating the mesh stiffness of the cracked gear and can be further used to serve the fault diagnosis and detection of the gear system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic response; Fault diagnosis; Gear mesh stiffness; Neutral layer; Open crack","Dynamic response; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Mesh generation; Spur gears; Stiffness; Stress intensity factors; Average percentage differences; Calculation models; Fault diagnosis and detections; Gear tooth crack; Statistical indicators; Time varying meshing stiffness; Tooth root crack; Traditional models; Gear teeth","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Long-term exposure to complex natural environment will cause different insulator defects. As a common defects, missing-cap defects of insulators will not only affect the structural strength of power insulators, but also bring a certain effect to the stable power transmission. With the rapid development of machine learning, some machine learning-based defect recognition methods have been proposed for fast and high-precision power inspection. However, the handcrafted features could not effectively express the aerial images against complex inspection environment to affect detection performance of the shallow learning algorithms. And the detection precision of deep learning algorithms will be affected by the unbalanced small-scale defects. Therefore, the fast and high-precision power inspection still faces a certain challenge in the smart grid. To address the above issues, fusion with the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and transfer learning, a novel fault diagnosis algorithm of power insulators is proposed to provide a fast and accurate power inspection scheme. To remove complex backgrounds, a fast insulator location algorithm based on the lightweight YOLOV4 model is proposed which is served for the following defect recognition. On the basis, to imitate human vision, a defect recognition algorithm is proposed based on multi-feature fusion. Meanwhile, to ensure the feature expression ability of transfer learning on power insulators, a novel optimization strategy of transfer learning is proposed to improve the recognition precision. Experiments show that the proposed method could acquire a good recognition performance than other recognition models.  © 2022 IEEE.","Aerial Images; Deep Convolutional Neural Network; Feature Fusion; Insulator Defect; Transfer Learning","Aircraft detection; Antennas; Complex networks; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Defects; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Power transmission; Smart power grids; Transfer learning; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerial images; Convolutional neural network; Deep convolutional neural network; Faults diagnosis; Features fusions; High-precision; Insulator defect; Machine-learning; Power; Transfer learning; Inspection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Except for these advantages, it still has an inevitable weakness-the communication over RPC (Remote Procedure Call) between services makes the system performance more unpredictable. Moreover, the complex interactions amongst services make it hard to reveal the root cause of performance issues. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight spectrum-based performance diagnosis tool, named T-Rank. T-Rank provides the ranked suspicious score in a list of microservices to localize root causes with very few resources.

It is of practical significance to improve the calculation speed of the model on the premise of ensuring accuracy, so as to realise real-time fault diagnosis. However, designing an efficient and lightweight fault diagnosis network requires expert knowledge to determine the network structure and adjust the hyperparameters of the network, which is time-consuming and laborious. In order to design fault diagnosis networks considering both time and accuracy effortlessly, a novel lightweight network with modified tree-structured parzen estimators (LN-MT) is proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Firstly, a lightweight framework based on global average pooling and group convolution is proposed, and a hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) method based on Bayesian optimisation called tree-structured parzen estimator is utilised to automatically search the optimal hyperparameters for the fault diagnosis task. The objective of the HPO algorithm is the weighting of accuracy and calculating time, so as to find models that balance both time and accuracy. The results of comparison experiments indicate that LN-MT can achieve superior fault diagnosis accuracies with few trainable parameters and less calculating time. © 2022 The Authors.

With the help of deep learning techniques, deep neural networks (DNNs) have great potential for machinery fault diagnosis. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy in various classifications of mechanical rotating parts. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are able to automatically learn multiple levels of representations from raw input datawithout introducing hand-coded rules or domain knowledge. Because of this powerful representation learning ability, deep learning has achieved great success in many fields. Although deep learning has achieved promising results in the field of machinery fault diagnosis, existing neural networks suffer from many limitations. The heavy and complex calculation amount puts forward strict requirements for computer hardware, which severely limits its application in actual engineering. To address this issue, this paper proposed a novel lightweight neural network model, ShuffleNet, for high-speed train wheelset bearing fault diagnosis. Based on the thought of module design, this model comprised several ShuffleNet units. Group convolution (GC) and deep separable convolution were used to improve the operation efficiency of traditional convolution in the ShuffleNet unit. Meanwhile, channel shuffle (CS) technology was adopted to overcome the grouping constraint caused by GC and improved the loss accuracy ofthenetwork model. CS operation makes it possible to build more powerful structures with multiple GC layers. Experimental results show that the proposed network model canbe applied in wheelset bearing fault diagnosis underacomplex working condition. Compared to the traditional CNN, ResNets, and Xception, the proposed method can greatly reducethecomputation cost while maintaining diagnosis accuracy. It is clear that the proposed lightweight neural network model, ShuffleNet, is superior to the above comparison models. This provides a new way forengineering applications of DNN technology and overcoming the limitations of computer hardware. © 2021, Science Press.

First of all, the Fourier transform was used to analyze the spectral characteristics of the outlet flowrate. Before wavelet transform was used, the data are standardized. This step eliminated the influence of the flowrate’s absolute value. Then, the wavelet coefficients under characteristic frequencies were extracted. Finally, the diagnosis criterion’s threshold, which indicates the surge occurrence, was defined from the perspective of safety margin. The criterion threshold alerted a surge only 1 s after it occurred.

With the emergence of the patrol inspection UAV, how to detect the target of the power line through the picture and carry out accurate positioning has become a major research focus of the intelligent power system. A method for detecting and locating power lines based on an encoding lightweight decoder network (EDN-light) is proposed in this paper. It provides a foundation for the research and development of intelligent inspection of power line network, such as detection and identification, fault location, and guarantee of operation safety, and puts forward a new solution to the fault location diagnosis of power line using image. By EDN-light network, it focuses on detecting high level target and eliminating irrelevant information such as background, the convolutional layer of the encoder is used for extracting features, and the deconvolutional layer of the decoder for reconstructing images. The EDN-light network can improve the detection accuracy, and generate high-quality segmentation object suggestions. Use Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation's aviation power line network dataset and self-made dataset to train the model to improve the generalization ability of the model. Experiments have found that due to the fully convolutional network design, it can carry out multi-scale input, For power line image segmentation and detection, the accuracy is better, and the evaluation indicators of the proposed models have increased.

Machine Learning (ML) based methods, developed recently, have demonstrated better performance in many fault diagnosis tasks. However, an unresolved challenge affecting their performance is the problem caused by difference between the source domain data used during the development and the target domain data encountered in operation in the field. Furthermore, the fault data in the target-domain are usually rare or not available for model training. Another constraint is that complex models are difficult to operate in real-time. This paper proposes a cross-domain DC series arc fault detection framework based on Lightweight Transfer Convolutional Neural Networks with Adversarial Data Augmentation (LTCNN-ADA) using limited target-domain fault data. Four datasets are prepared using different power sources and inverters in different operating conditions.

These methods are simple and accurate. However, all of these methods measure vibration data on the basis of the sampling theorem. Thus, they require a high measurement frequency, resulting in a large data volume and expensive measurement equipment. In recent years, a method that uses compressed sensing has been proposed to solve this problem, but it requires dedicated hardware to realize random sampling. To overcome this drawback, we developed a random start uniform sampling method (RSUSM) and combined it with compressed sensing (CS). RSUSM is a method of measuring data at a fixed frequency with a random start time. Numerical experiments demonstrate how the specific constant changes for each RSUSM parameter. This allows us to know the limit of how many measurement points are required for the number of non-zero components. We also applied CS by RSUSM to the sound pressure measurement results of the failed propeller, and found that the signal could be recovered less than 25% error even in a noisy real environment within the aforementioned limit. In this case, we found that the measurement frequency could be compressed to 1/80th of the frequency required by the sampling theorem, and the measurement data size to 1%. This approach is expected to diagnose faults in more rotating machines by significantly reducing the costs associated with data collection and storage.  © 2013 IEEE.","Compressed sensing; data compression; fault diagnosis; Fourier transforms; signal processing","Compressed sensing; Data compression; Digital storage; Fault detection; Fourier transforms; Propellers; Rotating machinery; Compressed-Sensing; Faults diagnosis; Frequency measurements; Noise measurements; Sampling method; Signal-processing; Uniform sampling; Vibration; Failure analysis","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Their manufacturing process includes trimming a reference resistance in STT-MRAM modules to reliably determine the logic values of 0 and 1 during read operations. Typically, an on-chip trimming routine consists of multiple runs of a test algorithm with different settings of a trimming port. It may inherently produce a large number of mismatches. Diagnosis of such a sizeable volume of errors by means of existing memory built-in self-test (MBIST) schemes is either infeasible or a time-consuming and expensive process. In this paper, we propose a new memory fault diagnosis scheme capable of handling STT-MRAM-specific error rates in an efficient manner. It relies on a convolutional reduction of memory outputs and continuous shifting of the resultant data to a tester through a few output channels that are typically available in designs using an on-chip test compression technology, such as the embedded deterministic test. It is shown that processing the STT-MRAM output by using a convolutional compactor is a preferable solution for this type of applications, as it provides a high diagnostic resolution while incurring a low hardware overhead over traditional MBIST logic. © 2021 IEEE.","convolutional compaction; DFT; fault diagnosis; memory built-in self-test; MRAM; STT-MRAM","Built-in self test; Cache memory; Computer circuits; Convolution; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Magnetic recording; Magnetic storage; Semiconductor device manufacture; Spin fluctuations; Static random access storage; System-on-chip; Trimming; Convolutional compactors; Diagnostic resolution; Embedded deterministic tests; Manufacturing process; Memory built in self tests; Reference resistance; Spin transfer torque; System on chip design; MRAM devices","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

For early fault diagnosis of ball bearings, acoustic emission signals are more sensitive and less affected by mechanical background noise. To cope with the large amount of data brought by the high sampling frequency and high sampling points of acoustic emission signals, a compressed sensing processing framework is introduced to research data compression and feature extraction, and a wavelet sparse convolutional network is proposed for resolved diagnosis and evaluation. The main research objective of this paper is to maximize the compression rate of the signal under the constraint of ensuring the reconstruction error of the acoustic emission signal, which can reduce the data volume of the acoustic emission signal and reduce the pressure of data analysis for subsequent fault diagnosis. At the same time, a wide convolution kernel based on a continuous wavelet is introduced when designing the neural network, and the energy information of different frequency bands of the signal is extracted by the wavelet convolution kernel to characterize the fault characteristics of the equipment. The energy pooling layer is designed to enhance the deep mining ability of compressed features, and the regularized loss function is introduced to improve the diagnostic accuracy and robustness through feature sparseness. The experimental results show that the method can effectively extract the fault characteristics of the bearing acoustic emission signal, improve the analysis efficiency and accurately classify the bearing faults. ©2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","acoustic emission signal; compressed sensing; convolution kernel; energy pooling layer; sparse feature; wavelet transform","Acoustic emission testing; Bearings (machine parts); Convolution; Data mining; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Wavelet transforms; Acoustic emission signal; Bearing fault diagnosis; Compressed-Sensing; Convolution kernel; Convolutional networks; Energy pooling; Energy pooling layer; Fault characteristics; Sparse features; Wavelets transform; article; compression; data analysis; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; loss of function mutation; mining; wavelet transform; Compressed sensing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

As one of the common faults of transformers, minor winding deformation cannot be easily detected and its effects are cumulative. This paper focuses on vibration characteristics of transformer windings under deformation conditions to provide a basis for transformer fault diagnosis. We have developed a finite element model of a three-phase transformer to simulate and to calculate the distribution of winding electromotive force, based on which the winding deformation trend is predicted. We designed three types of deformation. The winding axial vibration signal characteristics were studied in detail under different degrees of deformation. The simulation results show that the maximum force is applied to both ends of the winding, meanwhile the high and low voltage windings are subjected to outward expansion force and inward compression force respectively. When the winding is deformed, the frequency distribution and amplitude of the vibration signal will be changed. © 2021 IEEE.","axial vibration signal; fault diagnosis; Transformer windings deformation","Deformation; Electric fault currents; Electric power transmission networks; Fault detection; Power transformers; Transformer windings; Vibration analysis; Winding; Axial vibration signal; Axial vibrations; Common faults; Faults diagnosis; Mechanical structures; Power grids; Safe operation; Transformer winding deformations; Vibration signal; Winding deformations; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Consequently, their defectivity can strongly impact production yield for any automotive device. Along with the technology ramp-up phase and for statistical process control reasons during volume production, it is a good automotive industry practice to collect diagnostic information in addition to pure testing data. Designers and technology experts must receive accurate diagnostic results from failing devices to react to misbehavior by identifying and correcting the related issues at their source and drawing correct repair strategy conclusions. A commonly used approach resorts to the generation of failure bitmaps based on collecting all failing bits coordinates to be sent one by one to the tester. More efficiently, the encountered faults can be compacted or compressed in on-chip memory resources to be retrieved by the tester at the end of the memory test.This paper presents an on-chip method to compact diagnostic information during embedded memory testing. More specifically, the method is applied to diagnose embedded FLASH memories. This strategy permits the reconstruction of failure bitmaps without any loss, while compression approaches obtain an approximation. The proposed method uses a fraction of the memory requested by a coordinate-based bit mapping approach and is comparable to compression methods. At the cost of a moderate test time overhead, the proposed strategy permits dramatically increasing the number of devices that can be fully diagnosed without any bitmap reconstruction loss. Most failing devices in a real embedded FLASH production scenario were diagnosed after a single transfer from on-chip to the tester host computer.  © 2022 IEEE.","Automotive SoC; memory diagnosis; Reliability","Automotive industry; Embedded systems; Flash memory; Memory architecture; Programmable logic controllers; Statistical process control; Automotive SoC; Automotive Systems; Automotives; Bit maps; Diagnostic strategy; Diagnostics informations; Embedded memory; Memory diagnosis; On chips; Systems-on-Chip; System-on-chip","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Compressed sensing collects signals at a sampling rate far lower than Nyquist’s sampling theorem by using the signal sparse characteristics, so as to reduce the hardware pressure of data acquisition, transmission and storage. In this paper, a fault detection method based on compressed sensing for breaking and closing coils of HV circuit breakers is proposed. Firstly, the current model of circuit breaker opening and closing coil is built in MATLAB and Simulink to generate the simulation model signals, which can replace the actual signals for fault diagnosis and analysis. Then, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) was selected as the sparse basis matrix using the compressed sensing theory, and the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm was used to reconstruct the signals. By compressing and reducing the dimensions of the fault signals, the time-domain signals in the compression faults were extracted for fault detection. The experimental results show that this method can reduce the sampling rate and improve the efficiency and accuracy of fault diagnosis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Compressed sensing; Fault detection; High-voltage circuit breaker; Opening and closing coil","Data acquisition; Data handling; Digital storage; Discrete cosine transforms; Failure analysis; Fault detection; MATLAB; Signal reconstruction; Signal sampling; Time domain analysis; Timing circuits; Circuit-breakers; Compressed-Sensing; Detection methods; Faults detection; Faults diagnosis; High-voltage circuit breaker; High-voltage circuits; Opening and closing coil; Sampling rates; Voltage circuit breakers; Compressed sensing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Their especially deep architectures give them sufficient capacity to deal with very complex diagnosis issues. However, a neural network with excellent performance usually requires hundreds of thousands of parameters, which is unaffordable for use in current industrial machines due to their limited computational resources. To enable practical applications for fault diagnosis, developing deep learning methods that can perform powerfully and have an economical computational burden is necessary. This study proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on the wavelet packet transform (WPT) and a lightweight variant of DRN called a multi-branch deep residual network (MB-DRN) in order to resolve the above issues. WPT is utilized to map raw signals into the time-frequency domain, from which the MB-DRN can extract a set of robust features more easily. Additionally, MB-DRN builds several small-sized convolutional layer branches in each building block to increase the network non-linearity, the construction of layer branches can be achieved freely and this design strategy largely saves the parameter usage while approaching a stronger model's capacity. Two rolling bearing datasets with variable operating conditions were conducted on the proposed method to validate performance. The results verify the necessity of the WPT-based data processing method and show that MB-DRN can outperform the accuracies of standard DRN with only one quarter of the parameter amount, revealing the significant potential of the proposed method for realistic industrial fault diagnosis applications.  © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Bearing fault diagnosis; deep residual network; signal processing; wavelet packet transform","Data handling; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Frequency domain analysis; Learning systems; Packet networks; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bearing fault diagnosis; Computational resources; Data-driven fault diagnosis; Fault diagnosis applications; Multi-branch structures; Variable operating condition; Wavelet packet transform(WPT); Wavelet packet transforms; Roller bearings","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The monitoring systems for large structures are characterized by large numbers of measurement points and complex signal. In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in many fields, such as intelligent fault diagnosis and health monitoring due to its excellent feature extraction and nonlinear fitting ability. However, the existing deep networks for condition monitoring have some drawbacks. First, the multisensor information fusion is rarely considered, which is quite common in SHM systems. Second, most of the proposed models by current research are with large parameters and high complexity. To solve the problems mentioned above, we propose a lightweight SHM framework suitable for the multisensor monitoring tasks. In other words, the adaptive multisensor fusion network (ASF-Net) is proposed to dynamically mix with multichannel input samples and extract the efficient feature on different scales. Moreover, a joint loss function is established for network compression by transferring the knowledge from bulky teacher network to lightweight student network. Finally, to reduce the performance degradation during model compression, a multigeneration knowledge distillation (MGKD) strategy is proposed. The experiments on two SHM datasets show that the proposed method can achieve excellent classification accuracy, and model performance degradation of less than 2% can be obtained with at most 40.24 times less parameters and 128.82 times less computation, which has a great prospect on resource-constrained platforms. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Knowledge distillation (KD); lightweight network; model compression; sensor fusion; structural health monitoring (SHM)","Classification (of information); Complex networks; Deep learning; Distillation; Extraction; Structural health monitoring; Computational modelling; Deep learning; Features extraction; Knowledge distillation; Lightweight network; Model compression; Monitoring frameworks; Multi generations; Multi-sensor fusion; Sensor fusion; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, over time degradation can occur in the process, the process model and the controller, making it necessary to either re-tune the controller or re-identify the process model. Authors have proposed a variety of approaches to identify plant-model mismatch (PMM) and control performance degradation (CPD). While each approach may have its own advantages and disadvantages, they are generally designed to function on different timescales. The differing timescales result in the need for a multi-level hierarchical approach to monitor, detect, and manage PMM and CPD, as illustrated through a continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing application, i.e., a direct compression tablet manufacturing process. This work also highlights the requirement for index-based metrics, that enable the impact of PMM and CPD to be quantified and assessed from a control performance monitoring perspective, to aid fault diagnosis through root cause analysis to guide maintenance decisions for continuous manufacturing applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","control performance monitoring; nonlinear model predictive control; plant-model mismatch","","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Although researchers have proposed data-level and algorithm-level methods to solve this problem, these methods are only applicable to small imbalance scenarios. In order to correct the anomalies of model training under large imbalance scenarios, this paper proposes a gradient harmonized loss that coordinates the gradients of each class to prevent the majority class in the imbalanced data from dominating the training. The coordination of gradients is based on the similarity of the sample gradients, and the compression of similar gradients is achieved by defining different penalty rules for each class. Taking into account the computational efficiency and the training difficulty, the proposed method is further optimized in terms of gradient dimensionality reduction and parameter simplification respectively. The proposed method was verified using two sample sets with different imbalance ratios and compared with traditional methods. The results showed that the proposed method greatly improved the performance of the DCNN model in large imbalance scenarios. © 2022 IEEE.","gradient harmonization; imbalanced data; intelligent fault diagnosis; large imbalance scenarios; rotating machinery","Machinery; Data algorithm; Diagnosis model; Gradient harmonization; Harmonisation; Imbalanced data; Intelligent diagnosis; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Large imbalance scenario; Natural distribution; Performance; Computational efficiency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

There are some major problems that the existing techniques require large amount of storage, transmission and processing time for vibration signal. In this paper, an adaptive compressive sensing method is developed for vibration signals reconstruction based on optimal classification algorithm. Firstly, vibration signals were divided into blocks according to their cutting size and an energy sequence was produced in accordance with the energy of each signal block. Secondly, the energy sequence was classified by the QPSO algorithm to obtain the biggest variance. Whereafter, using the K-SVD algorithm, the proposed adaptive sparse dictionary learning framework enhances reconstruction capability of vibration signals. Finally, bearing fault testing experiment validates the effectiveness of the adaptive compression sensing method method. The proposed method has higher reconstruction performance than the classical K-SVD dictionary training method under the same compression ratio. The reconstruction accuracy is further improved and the reconstruction time is shortened.  © 2019 IEEE.","Adaptive compressed sensing; Axial piston pump; Bearing signal; Dictionary construction; Optimal classification","Compressed sensing; Pistons; Reciprocating pumps; Adaptive compression; Bearing fault diagnosis; Dictionary trainings; Optimal classification; Reconstruction accuracy; Reconstruction capability; Reliability and safeties; Sparse dictionaries; Signal reconstruction","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Lyngby, 2800, Denmark","Development of model-based fault diagnosis methods is a challenge when industrial systems are large and exhibit complex process behavior. Latent projection (LP), a statistical method that extract features of data via dimensionality reduction, is an alternative approach to diagnosis as it can be formulated to not rely on process knowledge. However, LP methods may perform poorly at identifying abnormal process variables due a “fault smearing” effect - variables unaffected by a fault are unintentionally characterized as being abnormal. The effect occurs because data compression permits faulty and non-faulty variables to interact. This paper presents an autoencoder (AE), a nonlinear LP method based on neural networks, as a monitoring method of a simulated nonlinear triple tank process (TTP). Simulated process data was used to train the AE to generate a monitoring statistic representing the condition of the TTP. Sparsity was introduced in the AE to reduce variable interactivity. The AE's ability to detect a fault was demonstrated. The individual contributions of process variables to the AE's monitoring statistic were analyzed to reveal the process variables that were no longer consistent with normal operating conditions. The key result in this study was that sparsity reduced fault smearing onto unaffected variables and increased the contributions of actual faulty variables. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

Moreover, the applicability of the model in engineering practice, especially in the Industrial Internet of Things context, puts forward higher requirements for its storage and computational costs. Considering these challenges, this article proposes an enhanced lightweight multiscale convolutional neural network (CNN) for rolling bearing fault diagnosis. Our contributions mainly fall into three aspects. Firstly, the proposed model is modular and easy to expand, which combines the idea of multiscale learning with attention mechanism and residual learning, enabling the network to extract more abundant and discriminative fault features directly from the raw vibration signal. Consequently, the proposed model can perform better. Secondly, the interpretability of the multiscale learning mechanism is explored by visualizing the extraction process of multiscale features. Finally, for the first time, we introduce the depthwise separable convolution into multiscale CNN to reduce the storage and computational costs of the model, which realizes the lightweight of the model and improves its applicability in the Industrial Internet of Things context. The experimental results on the rolling bearing dataset demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art multiscale CNN models, the proposed model has better discriminative fault feature extraction ability and anti-noise ability, and is more suitable for practical industrial systems.  © 2013 IEEE.","attention mechanism; lightweight; multiscale convolutional neural network; residual learning; Rolling bearing fault diagnosis","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Cost engineering; Costs; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Industrial internet of things (IIoT); Anti-noise ability; Attention mechanisms; Computational costs; Engineering practices; Environmental noise; Fault diagnosis method; Fault feature extractions; Multi-scale features; Roller bearings","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

With the advancement of the power Internet of Things construction, the high-voltage circuit breaker fault information of the entire power system can be stored in the cloud effectively, and the representativeness and comprehensiveness of fault samples are solved, so that artificial intelligence technologies that rely on a large number of samples can be applied, then the intelligent diagnosis of mechanical fault of switch equipment can be realized. From the perspective of the construction of power Internet of Things, this paper adopts the most advanced lightweight convolutional neural network and transfer learning to realize the intelligent diagnosis of mechanical fault of high-voltage circuit breaker. Firstly, an efficient lightweight convolutional neural network is constructed based on the principle that the model's depth, width, and resolution are balanced in the convolutional neural network, which avoids the dependence of feature engineering on expert experience. The lightweight convolutional neural network constructed in this paper not only has the highest recognition accuracy on the mechanical data set, but also greatly reduces the calculation and storage overhead of the model and ensures the real-time, fast, and accurate fault signals processing under the power Internet of Things. Then through transfer learning, it can ensure the maximum fault diagnosis accuracy in mechanical fault diagnosis of high voltage circuit breaker under the condition of small fault sample. Experiments prove that the lightweight convolutional neural network and transfer learning intelligent diagnosis method for high-voltage circuit breaker mechanical faults proposed in this paper have a diagnosis accuracy rate of more than 99% on the public rotation data set, and the recognition accuracy rate of migration to the highvoltage circuit breaker with 97.64%.

The method constructs an identification model of one-dimensional spectrum function for a system, and calculates the residual between the output spectrum and the estimated spectrum of the system in order to change iteration step length of identification and to get spectrum values of the first four orders. These four orders' NOFRF spectrum values are then sampled order by order with 10 values for each order, and a total of 40 spectrum values form a 40-dimensional feature vector. The resulting vectors are sent to the kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for compression by calculating the cumulative contribution rate of the principal component. The high-dimensional data are compressed into 3-dimensional data to reduce the nonlinearity between variables. An SVM classifier is constructed, and 60% of the low-dimensional data generated by KPCA are used as a training set to train the classifier, while the rest 40% of the data are used as a test set to identify faults. Experimental results and a comparison with GFRF show that the proposed method saves 85.4% of the processing time under the same data extraction task, and accurately and quickly extracts fault features of the system, which proves the reliability of the method in the application to fault diagnosis of industrial robot drive systems. © 2019, Editorial Office of Journal of Xi'an Jiaotong University.

Computational capabilities are unable to keep abreast of the subsequent processing requirements. Thus, a means of establishing computable prognostic models to accurately reflect process condition, whilst alleviating computational burdens, is essential. This is achievable by restricting the amount of information input that is redundant to modelling algorithms. In this paper, a variable clustering approach is investigated to reorganise the harmonics of common diagnostic features in rotating machinery into a smaller number of heterogeneous groups that reflect conditions of the machine with minimal information redundancy. Naïve Bayes classifiers established using a reduced number of highly sensitive input parameters realised superior classification powers over higher dimensional classifiers, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, generic parameter capabilities were evidenced through confirmatory factor analysis. Parameters with superior deterministic power were identified alongside complimentary, uncorrelated, variables. Particularly, variables with little explanatory capacity could be eliminated and lead to further variable reductions. Their information sustainability is also evaluated with Naïve Bayes classifiers, showing that successive classification rates are sufficiently high when the first few harmonics are used. Further gains were illustrated on compression of chosen envelope harmonic features. A Naïve Bayes classification model incorporating just two compressed input variables realised an 83.3% success rate, both an increase in classification rate and an immense improvement volume-wise on the former ten parameter model. © 2018, The Author(s).","big data; classification; data compression; Fault diagnosis; variable clustering","Big data; Computer aided diagnosis; Condition monitoring; Data compression; Factor analysis; Failure analysis; Harmonic analysis; Machinery; Amount of information; Bayes classification; Classification rates; Computational burden; Computational capability; Confirmatory factor analysis; variable clustering; Variable reductions; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

BLAKE algorithm is an efficient hash function which has been developed based on Bernstein's ChaCha stream cipher. Because of the fact that Google has chosen ChaCha along with Bernstein's Poly1305 message authentication code as a replacement for RC4 in TLS for Internet security, BLAKE's implementation is of paramount importance. In this paper, we present high-performance fault detection schemes for BLAKE. Specifically, for the round function, two fault diagnosis approaches are developed and analyzed in terms of error detection capability and overhead. Through our injection-based error simulations, we show that the error coverage of almost 100% can be achieved for the proposed approaches. In addition, through hardware platform benchmarks, we show that the proposed architectures have implementations which reach acceptable area/delay overheads. The proposed high-performance fault diagnosis approaches will make the hardware implementations of BLAKE more reliable. © 2019 IEEE.","Fault detection; hardware benchmark; lightweight crypto-Architectures.","Errors; Failure analysis; Hash functions; Side channel attack; Cryptographic algorithms; Detection capability; Fault detection schemes; Fault diagnosis schemes; Hardware implementations; Internet security; Message authentication codes; Proposed architectures; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The method based on deep belief network overcomes the shortcomings of traditional methods, but the amount of network parameters are so huge that the network is difficult to train. And Convolutional neural network based on time-frequency image requires wavelet transform to obtain time-frequency image. Based on the strong feature learning ability and generalization ability of convolutional neural network, a qualitative fault diagnosis method of bearing based on convolutional neural network is proposed, which is trained directly on one-dimensional vibration signal. There are several advantages of this method. The number of parameters are much less and training is more effective than the deep belief network. In addition, input doesn't require time-frequency image obtained by wavelet transform. A series of comprehensive tests are carried out by using the data of Case Western Reserve University and our laboratory. The result shows that the network can diagnose the bearing fault accurately and the accuracy is higher than the other methods. And the convolutional neural network trained on Case Western Reserve University's data can also accurately diagnoses the fault type of our laboratory's bearing, which indicates that the method can be used in practical. © 2019 IEEE.","convolutional neural network; one dimensional vibration signal; qualitative diagnosis","Convolution; Fault detection; Image compression; Manufacture; Wavelet transforms; Case Western Reserve University; Deep belief networks; Fault diagnosis method; Feature learning; Generalization ability; Network parameters; Time-frequency images; Vibration signal; Convolutional neural networks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In order to solve the difficult problem to distinguish leakage in gas pipelines, an approach of leakage detection using Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform (SST) and Stacked Contractive Auto-encoder (SCAE) was proposed. First, the sound signal in gas pipelines is subjected to simultaneous compression wavelet transform to obtain time-frequency images n grey-scale and normalized the image. Then, the time-frequency representations were compressed to the appropriate size. The compressed time-frequency matrix should be expanded into a column as the SCAE's input.

Resource-constrained devices use lightweight cryptographic algorithms to achieve a high level of security. It's always a trade-off between efficient resource utilization and level of security. Out of different attacks, in recent years, fault injection attacks is well matured. It becomes imperative to choose the best and efficient fault diagnosis schemes for lightweight cryptography.

The proposed fault detection technique for SKINNY round-based pipelined architecture is adapted. The result shows that the throughput overhead of the SKINNY remains within 2.5% variance for the proposed novel fault detection with a pipelined technique, a maximum of 10% area overhead. We have implemented the proposed fault detection scheme using Xilinx FPGA.

Rotor faults is a common fault in hydro-generators. The fault is not easy to detect in the early stage, but with the development of the fault, it will pose a threat to the safe operation of hydro-generator. Many faults will change the vibration of generator rotor. In order to detect small fault signals, time frequency compression stochastic resonance method (FCSR) is proposed. This method uses vibration noise to enhance weak fault signal characteristics. The frequency range of stochastic resonance can be improved by the time-frequency compression algorithm. The algorithm eliminates the limitation of the system on the measurement signal frequency and extends the stochastic resonance system to the whole frequency band. In addition, according to the rotor vibration of the hydro-generator, the range of the relevant parameters of the method is improved. The stochastic resonance method is used to reduce the noise of hydro-generator rotor vibration signal and improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal. This is conducive to the extraction of rotor fault feature vectors. The results show that the method can accurately identify the abnormal vibration of hydro-generator and has high rotor early fault diagnosis accuracy. © 2019 IEEE.","Fault diagnosis; Rotor fault; Stochastic resonance; —hydro-generator","Circuit resonance; Failure analysis; Hydroelectric generators; Hydroelectric power; Magnetic resonance; Signal to noise ratio; Stochastic systems; Systems engineering; Abnormal vibration; Diagnosis methods; Frequency ranges; Generator rotors; Hydro generator; Rotor fault; Signal frequencies; Stochastic resonances; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In this case, this paper proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) method for intelligent fault diagnosis of bearing, which can largely satisfy the need of less parameter amount and storage space as well as high accuracy. First, depthiwise separable convolution is adopted, and a LCNN structure is constructed through an inverse residual structure and a linear bottleneck layer operation. Secondly, a novel decomposed Hierarchical Search Space is introduced to automatically explore the optimal LCNN for bearing fault diagnosis in the context of the IIoT.

As the source of the feedback control system, the Inertial navigation system/Global position system (INS/GPS) is the premise of flight control system security. However, unmanned aerial vehicles have the requirement of lightweight and low cost for airborne equipment, which makes redundant device object unrealistic. Therefore, the method of fault detection and diagnosis is desperately needed. In this paper, a fault detection and diagnosis method based on fuzzy system and neural network is proposed. Fuzzy system does not depend on the mathematical model of the process, which overcomes the difficulties in obtaining the accurate model of unmanned aerial vehicles. Neural network has a strong self-learning ability, which could be used to optimize the membership function of fuzzy system. This paper is structured as follows: first, a Kalman filter observer is introduced to calculate the residual sequences caused by different sensor faults. Then, the sequences are transmitted to the fault detection and diagnosis system and fault type can be obtained. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm was implemented and evaluated with real datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can detect the sensor faults successfully with high levels of accuracy and efficiency. © IMechE 2018.","fault detection and diagnosis; fuzzy system; Kalman filter; neural network; Unmanned aerial vehicles","Adaptive control systems; Air navigation; Aircraft detection; Antennas; Feedback control; Flight control systems; Fuzzy filters; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Inertial navigation systems; Kalman filters; Membership functions; Neural networks; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Accurate modeling; Airborne equipments; Fault data injections; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault detection and diagnosis methods; Fault detection and diagnosis systems; Secure control systems; Self-learning ability; Fault detection","Review","Final","","Scopus"

Timely detection of various faults helps to improve the performance of the complex industries, prevent various unfavorable consequences and reduce the maintenance cost. Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) for process monitoring and control has been an active field of research for the past two decades. Distillation columns are inherently nonlinear, and thus to have an accurate and robust performance, the fault detection methods should be based on nonlinear dynamic methods. The paper presents a robust data-driven fault detection approach for realistic tray upsets in the distillation column. The detection of tray faults in the distillation column is conducted by Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous Input (NARX) network with Tapped Delay Lines (TDL). Aspen Plus® Dynamic simulation has been used to generate normal and faulty datasets. The study shows that the proposed method can be used for the detection of tray faults in distillation column for dynamic process monitoring.

After that, the compressed signal will be used for fault diagnosis by feature extraction and fault classification. However, traditional fault diagnosis heavily depends on the prior knowledge and requires a signal reconstruction which will cost great time consumption. For this problem, a deep belief network (DBN) is used here for fault detection directly on compressed signal. This is the first time DBN is combined with the compressive sensing. The PCA analysis shows that DBN has successfully separated different features. The DBN method which is tested on compressed gearbox signal, achieves 92.5 % accuracy for 25 % compressed signal. We compare the DBN on both compressed and reconstructed signal, and find that the DBN using compressed signal not only achieves better accuracies, but also costs less time when compression ratio is less than 0.35.

A novel condition monitoring method for WT planetary gearbox is proposed in this article. This method can identify and predict the fault in the initial stage. Raw vibration signals are gathered from WT planetary gearbox through an enhanced piezoelectric self-powered wireless sensor. First, after the data processing back-end receives the original samples transmitted by the wireless sensor, the high-dimensional raw vibration signals are compressed and collected by adopting a random Bernoulli matrix to obtain the compressed samples containing the characteristics of the raw signals by compressed sensing (CS). Moreover, the operation of reducing the signal dimension not only eliminates noise pollution but also greatly reduces the overall calculation. Second, the training part of compressed samples is first exploited to optimize the deep belief network (DBN) by the chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization (CQPSO) algorithm. In the optimization process, the CQPSO algorithm can avoid local optimal problem better compared with traditional quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, which ensures that the optimized DBN architecture can extract distinguishing and deep features from compressed samples. Furthermore, the choice of compression ratio (CR) is realized in this process with the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) classifier. Third, testing samples are input into the DBN structure. A regression layer added on the last hidden layer, which stores extracted features, achieves the prediction of fault. In addition, LSSVM is exploited to distinguish fault types of features.

However, DL exposes the problems of large sample size and long training time, and in actual working conditions, the amount of labeled fault data available is relatively small, so a DL model of good generalization and high accuracy is difficult to be trained. In order to solve these problems, a deep transfer convolutional neural network (DTCNN) is proposed in this research. ResNet-50 is selected as the pre-trained model of deep convolutional neural network, and is transferred to solve the problem of bearing fault classification based on the idea of transfer learning. Firstly, raw fault signals are converted into time-frequency images by using continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, the images are further converted into RGB formats, which are used as the input of DTCNN. Finally, an end-to-end fault diagnosis model based on DTCNN is designed. The proposed method is validated on two datasets collected from motor bearing and self-priming centrifugal pump, respectively. Most sub-datasets from motor bearing show the prediction accuracies near 100%, and in the self-priming centrifugal pump dataset, we achieve improvement in accuracy from 99.48%±0.1966 to 99.98%±0.0332. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other DL methods and traditional machine-learning methods. © 2013 IEEE.","continuous wavelet transform; convolutional neural network; Fault diagnosis; rolling bearing; transfer learning","Centrifugal pumps; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Image compression; Learning systems; Roller bearings; Transfer learning; Wavelet transforms; Continuous wavelet transforms; Fault diagnosis model; Machine fault diagnosis; Machine learning methods; Prediction accuracy; Self-priming centrifugal pumps; Time frequency analysis; Time-frequency images; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Compared with machine learning and classical convolutional neural networks, SIRCNN has a smaller model size, faster diagnosis speed and extraordinary robustness. The lightweight of the model is achieved through the application of depthwise separable convolution. Moreover, using the inverted residual structure ensures the accuracy of the model in noisy environments.

On the one hand, it is challenging for hardwareconstrained sensor platforms to handle and process high volumes of sampled data. On the other hand, the requirement of high sampling rate is only imposed to capture higher harmonics arising during faults, and a much lower sampling rate will suffice for recording data during normal operation. We propose fault aware compressive sampling, FACS for short, which is an algorithm for enabling high rate sampling of data in smart distribution systems. FACS takes advantage of dichotomy in sampling rate requirement and seamlessly switches to a lower resolution for fault-free cycles. This poster reports performance of a simple realization of our general algorithm implemented on a low-cost Parallela board. Our implementation could handle 32kHz sampling rate while losslessly compressing real-time, streaming measurement data using less than 10ms per cycle. We have benchmarked the compression and fault-detection performance of our algorithm for synthetic fault data. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Data acquisition; Electric fault currents; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Compressive sampling; Detection performance; High sampling rates; Higher harmonics; Measurement data; Normal operations; Smart distribution networks; Smart distribution systems; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In light of this problem, an adaptive compressed sensing of mechanical vibration signals based on sparsity fitting method is proposed. First, the multi-scale wavelet packet transform is carried out on the mechanical vibration signal, and its sparsity is obtained by zeroing the wavelet packet coefficient at a certain threshold value. Then, the iterative method is adopted to obtain the minimum sampling rate that meets the requirements of reconstruction signal accuracy under each sparsity degree, and the sparsity degree and sampling rate are fitted with the least square method to eliminate the signal measurement error for an optimal signal sampling rate. Finally, an over-complete dictionary adapted to each signal block is constructed by K-singular value decomposition algorithm, and the signals are reconstructed by orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Experiments show that the signal compression rate and reconstruction accuracy of this algorithm are greatly improved compared with the traditional compression algorithm. © 2020, Editorial Department of JVMD.

Compared with common diagnosis methods, such as expert systems that depend on the professional experience and information of fault, the model-based diagnosis (MBD) has many distinct advantages. However, the efficiency and accuracy of the calculation of the minimum hitting set (MHS) limit the performance of MBD. To overcome these limitations, an MHS algorithm with a prejudging mechanism is proposed in this article. This mechanism is constructed based on the distribution characteristics of MHS. The use of this mechanism prior to MHS calculation enables the removal of most non-HS particles and all super-MHS particles and enables the compression of the MHS calculation solution space several times. Moreover, after compression, only two types of particles remain in the left solution space, which are non-HS and MHS. As a result, the MHS can be picked out directly through the HS fitness function and the HS criterion and by avoiding the participation of the MHS ensured strategy (MHSES). Three cases studies have been introduced to test the effect of the prejudging mechanism on the performance of the MHS calculation. In addition, a discussion on the MBD of the distribution networks has been presented to validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Distribution network; fault diagnosis; model-based diagnosis (MBD); particles; prejudging mechanism; stability","Efficiency; Expert systems; Failure analysis; Diagnosis methods; Distribution characteristics; Fitness functions; Minimum hitting set; Model based diagnosis; Model-based fault diagnosis; Professional experiences; Reliability and stability; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, since a cloud application often has a large amount of different microservices, it is difficult for operators to analyze these microservices with a unified model. To deal with the above problem, this paper proposes a sequential trace-based fault diagnosis framework called as Midiag by mining the patterns of microservices’ system call sequences. Midiag collects system calls with a non-invasive lightweight tool, and then uses k-means to cluster system call sequences as patterns with the longest common subsequence. The GRU-based neural network is employed to model the patterns of system call sequences to predict the next system call, and thus we can diagnose faults by comparing the predicted next system call and the actual next one in the specific pattern. We have validated Midiag with many different types of applications deployed in containers. The results demonstrate that Midiag can well classify these applications as different types and accurately diagnose the injected faults. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cloud applications; Fault diagnosis; Microservices; System call","Data Sharing; Failure analysis; Fault detection; K-means clustering; Cloud applications; Cluster systems; Large amounts; Longest common subsequences; Management efficiency; System calls; System-call sequence; Unified Modeling; Information management","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The main purpose of this study is to reduce the test response data consumption while achieving higher fault coverage using new Haar wavelet transforms. Considering the faultiness of test compression, this article would like to introduce the '3-D Haar wavelet transforms,' which would update part of 2-D butterfly unit into 3-D butterfly unit based on the traditional Haar wavelet transforms to simplify the test response output nodes. To better achieve the purpose, a new no-X-unknown-carry adder is applied to build 3-D no-X-unknown-carry Haar wavelet transform (3-D_NxUC_HWT), which not only could solve X-masking but also could transmit an X-bit efficiently to make a delay fault diagnosis. In addition, the constructed reuse architecture makes it possible to plan reasonably the test compression structure by making full use of monolithic interlayer vias to shorten the parallel transmission length. In this study, the test point data are output to the test compressor in parallel through interlayer vias and the compressed results are shifted out by serial scan chain to shorten the test time.

In the first stage, CS is utilized to obtain compressively sampled signals from raw vibration data. In the second stage, an effective multistep feature learning algorithm obtains fewer features from correlated principal and discriminant attributes from the compressively sampled signals, which are then concatenated to increase the performance. In the third stage, with these concatenated features, multiclass support vector machine is used to train, validate, and classify bearing faults. Results show that the proposed method, CS-CPDC, offers high classification accuracies, reduced computation time, and storage requirement, with fewer measurements. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Bearing fault classification; Canonical correlation analysis (CCA); Compressive sampling (CS); Linear discriminant analysis (LDA); Machine condition monitoring (MCM); Principal component analysis (PCA)","Compressed sensing; Condition monitoring; Data compression; Digital storage; Discriminant analysis; Image retrieval; Learning algorithms; Principal component analysis; Roller bearings; Support vector machines; Bearing fault; Canonical correlation analysis; Compressive sampling; Linear discriminant analysis; Machine condition monitoring; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The method of time-frequency analysis can reveal exactly the frequency components and time-varying characteristics of vibration signals of HVCB. Time-frequency image which constructed by using the time-frequency analysis method contains rich feature information of HVCB's working condition. In this paper, a novel condition evaluation method for the opening damper of HVCB based on vibration time-frequency image and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed and analyzed. Firstly, the vibration signal is converted into time-frequency image by using wavelet transform (WT). Then, texture features and shape features of the time-frequency image are extracted as eigenvectors. Finally, SVM is used to classify the working status of the opening damper. The experimental results show that the method can effectively evaluate the condition of the opening damper.

In recent years, due to the strong recognition ability, data-driven fault diagnosis technology based on deep learning has attracted enormous attention. The fault diagnosis module proposed by many scholars has achieved excellent recognition results, but some of them are too complex to deploy in practice, due to the high costs. In this article, an efficient feature extraction method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNN) was proposed, and the high-precision fault diagnosis task was completed used a lightweight network. First, a 1-D CNN (1-D-CNN) is used to extract the multichannel features for the input original signals, to generate the feature maps which are highly consistent with the 2-D CNN (2-D-CNN). Second, a strategy of the lightweight model is proposed based on the principle of dynamic convolution and separable convolution. Third, a spatial attention mechanism (SAM) is used to adjust the weights of the output feature maps. Finally, the model completes the diagnosis task through the learned features.

Due to the complexity and the nature of distributed systems all this data needs to be communicated among the network, which is an expensive affair in terms of communication resources and time. In this paper we present compression strategies that utilize the fact that many of these data streams are highly correlated and can be compressed simultaneously. Experimental results show that this can lead to better compression ratios compared to an individual compression of the data streams.

In resource-related constraints, the design of a lightweight method to automatically diagnose the fault in WSN is highly beneficial. In this study, the authors propose lightweight and less-overhead approaches to diagnose hard and soft faults in WSNs automatically. Correctly, a lightweight checksum method is implemented for hard or crash fault detection. This method is capable of detecting multiple hard faults within a single path with the help of a timeout mechanism. For diagnosis of soft faults such as permanent, intermittent, and transient faults, they implement the Anderson-Darling (AD) statistical method. The AD test analyses how the sensor readings are fitted in a specific distribution for a tested significance level. Several testbed experiments are conducted to validate their hypotheses and implementations. The performance parameters that are evaluated in this work include fault detection accuracy, false alarm rate, and false-positive rate. These parameters are evaluated about various fault probabilities in the network. They observe that the proposed lightweight schemes can diagnose both hard and soft faults in O(1) message complexity over the network, which makes it adaptable in practise. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","","Failure analysis; Wireless sensor networks; False positive rates; Fault probabilities; Performance parameters; Research communities; Resource-related constraints; Significance levels; Specific distribution; Wireless sensor network (WSNs); Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Electro-mechanical actuator (EMA), which we study on, widely used in a new generation of aircraft serves as the research object. The basic fault diagnosis framework of this work is based on Time Series Modeling (TSM), which builds a model for each sensor data, then faults can be detected and isolated by differences between model prediction result and measured result. In this structure, the quantity of sensors is directly related to the fault diagnosis effect, that is, the fault detection capability increases when the number of sensors increases. Simultaneously, the workload of the model training increases without expectation. Therefore, the reduction of sensors is of great significance. The traditional method is to use the manual experience to screen, but this method has high requirements on personal ability and performance is not easy to guarantee. This paper adopts the Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE) algorithm, which avoids the simple direct screening process and achieves the purpose of reducing the number of sensors by adaptively extracting features. Important features of sensor data, preserved by loss compression using SAE, can be used to build time series models. Relationship of time series adjacent data is adopted to build mathematical models. Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm can make good use of the relationship between time series, which has been widely used in speech recognition, text recognition, and other fields. However, standard RNN algorithm tends to ignore future information. In this paper, the Bidirectional Long Short-term Memory RNN algorithm (BiLSTM-RNN), considering both past data and future data, is applied to TSM.

Following this, model-based fault-tolerant control and fault accommodation algorithms are presented for two challenging classes of distributed systems: a spatially distributed system that can be decomposed into interconnected subsystems, and a distributed parameter system where the system state is distributed over a continuous range of space. The authors present recent research on fault-tolerant control systems for unmanned aerial systems, particularly for multirotor-type vehicles commonly known as drones. An overview of tools for the analysis of the fundamental properties of an automated system is provided, allowing for any inherent redundancy in the controlled process to be utilised to maintain availability. Additionally, a reconfigurable fault-tolerant flight control system is proposed to combat sensor/actuator faults for autonomous underwater vehicles. The reconfigurable design and operation of complex systems is addressed, with emphasis on autonomous systems, building upon concepts of autonomy, incipient failure diagnosis and prognosis algorithms. The authors present a fault detection filter for induction motors speed as a class of nonlinear system in networked control systems subject to induced time delays. The multi-model approach for the modeling of induction motors is described using a set of linear models. In the concluding study, the construction of an induction motor is presented, and a review of induction motor failures is discussed. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Firstly, the correlation analysis of the voltage or current data running in various fault states is performed to remove the redundant features and the sampling point. Secondly, the wavelet transform is used to remove the redundant data of the features, and then the training sample data is greatly compressed. The deep feedforward network is trained by the low frequency component of the features, while the training speed is greatly accelerated.

Aiming at this, an intelligent fault diagnosis method was proposed based on the texture features of synchrosqueezing wavelet transform(SST)time-frequency distribution images. The EEMD method was adopted to preprocess the vibration signal of the projectile delivery system, and to calculate the correlation coefficient of the decomposed components. The first four layers with high correlation coefficient were selected to reconstruct the signal for reducing the noise effect. Then, the vibration signals of different states of the transmissive bomb system were dealt with by the time-frequency analysis with the synchrosqueezing wavelet transform to obtain two-dimensional time-frequency images reflecting different operating states, and the gray-scale processing was performed. The gray level co-occurrence matrix method and the gray gradient co-occurrence matrix were used to extract the texture features. In order to compare with the traditional method, the energy percentage of the first four layers with large correlation coefficient of the original signal was taken as a feature after the signal was decomposed by EEMD. The method of kernel-based fuzzy C-means clustering, was used to do the classification and recognition of the image texture features and the image features of three different state vibration signals of the supply and delivery bomb system respectively, and the results were compared with those of the fuzzy C-means clustering. The experimental results show that the method can effectively recognize the early failure of automatic missile systems and the recognition accuracy is 91.21%. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

The relevant electronic circuits with fault diagnostics, including the optimized neural network algorithm model, are designed on the basis of symmetry principles. In order to improve the efficiency of the circuit pressure test, a circuit pressure function equivalent compression test method based on the parallel neural network algorithm is proposed. For the implementation stage of the circuit pressure test, the improved modified node algorithm (MNA) is used to build an optimization model, and the circuit network is converted into an ordinary differential equation for the circuit pressure function equivalent compression test. The test aims to minimize flux. Then, backpropagation (BP) neural network algorithm data fusion is introduced to optimize the minimum flux model of the cyclic pressure functional equivalent compression test. Finally, a simulation experiment is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm in the accuracy and efficiency of the pressure test. The results show that the improved BP neural network improves the data fusion accuracy and shortens the sample training time; compared with the uncompressed algorithm, the running time of the proposed algorithm is greatly reduced and the execution efficiency is high; compared with the vascular pressure test method, there is no significant difference in the convergence accuracy and it is at a level of 10-5. Since the parallel computing problem is not considered in either of the two-pulse tube pressure test methods, the convergence time of the algorithm increases exponentially with the increase in the number of parallel threads. However, the algorithm in this research considers the problem of parallel execution and uses a quad-core processor, with no significant change in computing time and high computing efficiency. Therefore, BP neural network data fusion can be used for the fault diagnosis of electronic circuits, with a high operating efficiency and good development prospects. © 2020 by the authors.

This cannot benefit for the subsequent fine-tuning phase of fault classification. To alleviate this problem, an extended deep belief network (EDBN) is proposed to fully exploit useful information in the raw data, in which raw data is combined with the hidden features as inputs to each extended restricted Boltzmann machine (ERBM) during the pre-training phase.

It requires timely detection of anomalies which are present with noisy measurements of a large number of variable, highly correlated data with complex interactions and fault symptoms. This study proposes the robust fault detection method for the distillation column. Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) for process monitoring and control has been an effective field of research for two decades. This area has been used widely in sophisticated engineering design applications to ensure the proper functionality and performance diagnosis of advanced and complex technologies. Robust fault detection of the realistic faults in distillation column in dynamic condition has been considered in this study. For early detection of faults, the model is based on nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network. Tapped delays lines (TDLs) have been used for the input and output sequences. A case study was carried out with three different fault scenarios, i.e., valve sticking at reflux and reboiler, and tray upset. These faults would cause the product degradation. The normal data (no fault) is used for the training of neural network in all three cases. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can be used for the detection of both internal and external faults in the distillation column for dynamic system monitoring and to predict the probability of failure. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Aspen plus<sup>®</sup> simulation; Distillation column; Fault detection; NARX neural network; Nonlinear process; Process monitoring","Complex networks; Distillation columns; Distilleries; Electric fault currents; Neural networks; Process monitoring; Fault detection and diagnosis; NARX neural network; Non-linear autoregressive with exogenous; Performance diagnosis; Probability of failure; Process monitoring and control; Product degradation; Robust fault detection; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Undiagnosed faults in the machinery's components produce a high rate of unplanned stoppage of production processes that can even result in catastrophic consequences. Fault diagnosis in reciprocating compressors requires complex and time-consuming feature-extraction processes because typical fault diagnosers cannot deal directly with raw signals. In this paper, we streamline the deep learning and optimization algorithms for effective fault diagnosis on these machines. The proposed approach iteratively trains a group of long short-term memory (LSTM) models from a time-series representation of the vibration signals collected from a compressor. The hyperparameter search is guided by a Bayesian approach bounding the search space in each iteration. Our approach is applied to diagnose failures in intake/discharge valves on double-stage machinery. The fault-recognition accuracy of the best model reaches 93% after statistical selection between a group of candidate models. Additionally, a comparison with classical approaches, state-of-the-art deep learning-based fault-diagnosis approaches, and the LSTM-based model shows a remarkable improvement in performance by using the proposed approach. © 2019","Bayesian optimization; Deep learning; LSTM; Reciprocating compressor; Time-series dimensionality reduction","Bayesian networks; Compressed air; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Iterative methods; Long short-term memory; Time series; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian optimization; Catastrophic consequences; Classical approach; Dimensionality reduction; LSTM; Optimization algorithms; Statistical selection; algorithm; Article; Bayesian learning; Bayesian optimization; controlled study; deep learning; fault diagnosis; long short term memory network; machine; measurement accuracy; priority journal; process optimization; statistical analysis; time series analysis; vibration; Reciprocating compressors","Article","Final","","Scopus"

When using intelligent diagnostic methods to diagnose bearing faults, the increasingly complex working conditions and the huge amount of data make it a great challenge to diagnose fault quickly and effectively. In this paper, a novel fault diagnosis method based on sparse auto-encoder (SAE), combined with compression sensing (CS) and wavelet packet energy entropy (WPEE) for feature dimension reduction is proposed. Firstly, vibration signals of each fault type are projected linearly through compressed sensing to obtain compressed signals, which are merged into a low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multiple fault types. Secondly, the WPEE of low-dimensional compressed signal matrix of multi-fault type is determined, and the eigenvector matrix of bearing fault diagnosis is formed, which greatly reduces the dimension of the eigenvector matrix.

The project is funded by Innovate UK and is a collaboration between Process Vision and the   University of Reading. Recent advances in robotics are making many inspection and maintenance tasks possible. The objective of the project is to provide a proof of concept prototype that can increase plant availability, by reducing the   need for inspection shutdowns. As well as improving safety by reducing confined space working and reduce shutdown durations, as online diagnostics will help shutdown planning and logistics. If internal inspections could be performed   without the need to shut down this would:  Reduce downtime and increase efficiency in production  Reduce OPEX  Provide a safety benefit by reducing confined space working  Provide an environmental benefit by reducing the gas sent to   flare to de-pressurise  Reduce fixed costs  Allow fewer man hours in inspection tasks  Remove the need for purge gas – nitrogen or air  Reduce the number of procedures required  Reduce the amount of paperwork The paper details fouling,   scaling and coking problems in many gas and liquid processes and a solution to improve inspection and maintenance tasks. With a snake robot that has a fixed base, a manoeuvrable camera and other tools at the tip, the robot has been   designed to enter high pressure vessels and pipelines via a small diameter tapping point while the plant is in operation. Fig 1. The self-supporting snake provides a live video feed for real time operations to troubleshoot and has been   designed to inspect internal equipment such a bubble trays in gas treatment and distillation towers, flash drums and knock-out pots, as well as gas/liquid separator systems. It is anticipated that the robot will be able to safely access   systems via existing tapping points and will become a versatile tool to perform several tasks that currently require a plant shutdown. Videos of trials in test rigs will be presented together with details of, the design process,   operational envelope, manoeuvrability, control and operator interface of the multi-jointed robot. With the robot anchored at the entry point, it will be able to improve fault diagnosis and investigate the internal condition of pressure   vessels and piping to identify areas of corrosion, troubleshoot and remove problems such as foaming or fouling. The inclusion of a material extraction line allows the system to remove fluids from a high pressure-vessel to a holding tank   for disposal. By keeping the plant free of fouling it is expected that process efficiency will remain higher than the normal decline to the point where shutdown is necessary to remove fouling and for the performance of other remediation   tasks.

Therefore, it is important to monitor and diagnose the health status of rolling bearings. A convolutional neural network is widely used in the field of fault diagnosis because it does not require feature extraction. Considering that the size of the network model is large and the requirements for monitoring equipment are high. This study proposes a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on lightweight network ShuffleNet V2 with batch normalization and L2 regularization. In the experiment, the one-dimensional time-domain signal is converted into a two-dimensional Time-Frequency Graph (TFG) using a short-time Fourier transform, though the principle of graphics to enhance the TFG dataset. The model mainly consists of two units, one for extracting features and one for spatial down-sampling. The building units are repeatedly stacked to construct the whole model. By comparing the proposed method with the origin ShufflNet V2, machine learning model and state-of-the-art fault diagnosis model, the generalization of the proposed method for bearing fault diagnosis is verified. © 2019 by the authors.

They are vulnerable to performance problems due to the highly dynamic runtime environment changes (e.g., overload and resource contention) or software bugs (e.g., memory leak). Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult to diagnose the root causes of these performance problems in a fine granularity due to complicated interactions and a large cardinality of potential cause set. In this paper, we build an automated, black-box and end-to-end cause inference system named CauseInfer to pinpoint the root causes or at least provide some hints. CauseInfer can automatically map a distributed system to a two-layer hierarchical causality graph and infer the root causes along the causal paths in the causality graph. CauseInfer models the fault propagation paths in an explicit way and works without instrumentation to the running production system, which makes CauseInfer more effective and practical than previous approaches. The experimental evaluations in two benchmark systems show that CauseInfer can identify the root causes in a high accuracy. Compared to several state-of-the-art approaches, CauseInfer can achieve over 10 percent improvement. Moreover, CauseInfer is lightweight and flexible enough to readily scale out in large distributed systems. With CauseInfer, the mean time to recovery (MTTR) of the cloud systems can be significantly reduced. © 2019 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

In this paper, fault diagnosis of a distillation column is formulated as an inverse problem. The nonlinear least squares algorithm is used to evaluate fault parameters embedded in a nonlinear dynamic model of distillation once abnormal symptoms are detected. A partial least squares regression model is built based on fault parameter history to explicitly predict the development of fault parameters. With the stripper of Tennessee Eastman process as example, this novel approach is tested for step- and random-type faults and several factors affecting its efficiency are discussed.

Long short-term memory networks (LSTM) have received a great deal of attention in this field. Most of the LSTM-based fault diagnosis methods have too many parameters and calculation, resulting in large memory occupancy and high calculation delay. Thus, this paper proposes a low-delay lightweight recurrent neural network (LLRNN) model for mechanical fault diagnosis, based on a special LSTM cell structure with a forget gate. The input vibration signal is segmented into several shorter sub-signals in order to shorten the length of the time sequence. Then, these sub-signals are sent into the network directly and converted into the final diagnostic results without any manual participation. Compared with some existing methods, our experiments illustrate that the proposed method has less memory space occupancy and lower computational delay while maintaining the same level of accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.

This method improves the model structure of the traditional CNN by using a global average pooling layer to replace the fully connected layer of 23 layers. The improved CNN-GAP method mainly contains an input layer, a feature extraction layer, a global average pooling (GAP) layer, and a Softmax output layer. Firstly, the raw 1-D time-series data directly input into the input layer of the established CNN-GAP diagnosis model. The 2-D feature maps are reconstructed in the input layer. Secondly, the representative features are automatically extracted from the 2-D feature maps by using multiple convolutional layers and pooling layers. Thirdly, the dimension transformation and size compression of the output image of the feature extraction layer is completed by the GAP layer. Finally, the fault diagnosis result of the DC-DC inverter is automatically output in the Softmax output layer. The proposed method is used for diagnosing the open-circuit fault of the IGBT in the isolated DC-DC inverter. The proposed method is more accurate and effective than other mainstream intelligent diagnosis methods including the SVM, KNN, DNN, and traditional CNN. The experiment results show that the diagnostic accuracy is up to 99.95%, and the testing time can reduce by more than 15%. The improved CNN-GAP method could greatly reduce the model parameter quantity of the traditional CNN more than 80%, which is more suitable for rapid fault diagnosis in electronic devices. © 2013 IEEE.","2-D feature image; convolutional neural network; data-driven; DC-DC inverter; deep learning; global average pooling; IGBT open-circuit fault; Intelligent fault diagnosis","Convolution; DC-DC converters; Electric inverters; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Diagnostic accuracy; Dimension transformations; Electrical power; Electronic device; Intelligent diagnosis methods; Model parameters; Open circuit faults; Time-series data; Convolutional neural networks","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

When new task data not considered in the training stage are generated during the operation of the equipment, it is difficult for the model to recognize this type of data. If only new task data are used in training, it will lead to poor performance in the old task. When using all the data in training, with the accumulation of task data, the cost of data storage will increase and the speed of model update will be greatly reduced. Therefore, an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on the layer regeneration network under class imbalanced samples is proposed, which uses only new task data to update the model. The method holds that the data contain some information of other categories, but they are covered by information of their own categories, and the knowledge between classes is extracted by knowledge distillation to enhance the learning of other categories. First, the cross-domain learning method based on parameter transfer is adopted to make the layer regeneration network model (LRNM) converge quickly on the new task. Then, the implicit knowledge related to the old task in the new task data is extracted by the distillation learning method to adjust global parameters, alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem in model updating, and realize the model continuous learning. Through experiments, the use of dark knowledge can effectively enhance the learning of other types of knowledge.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Dark knowledge; intelligent fault diagnosis; knowledge distillation; layer regeneration; parameter tuning","Data mining; Deep learning; Digital storage; Distillation; Distilleries; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Network layers; Catastrophic forgetting problem; Continuous learning; Cross-domain learning; Global parameters; Implicit knowledge; Intelligent fault diagnosis; Mechanical equipment fault; Parameter transfers; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In order to improve the signal reconstruction results, adaptive block forward and backward stagewise orthogonal matching pursuit (Adaptive Block-FBStOMP) algorithm based on adaptive block method is proposed. Firstly, the adaptive block length of the rolling bearing fault signal is determined according to the short-time autocorrelation algorithm, and the signal is divided into signal blocks according to the adaptive block length to equalize the sparsity of each block. Secondly, the K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm is used to train the sparse dictionary of each block to obtain better sparse effect. Finally, the FBStOMP reconstruction algorithm is proposed. The atom backtracking and quadratic screening processes are added in the reconstruction process to improve the possibility that all the effective support set atoms can be selected into the support set.

It is of great importance to detect and diagnose faults in distillation process. Due to the strong feedback and coupling of processes in a distillation column, it is difficult to use deep auto-encoders (DAEs) alone to achieve good results in detecting and diagnosing faults, in terms of accuracy and efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid fault-diagnosis model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and DAEs, by integrating the powerful capability of CNN in feature extraction and of DAE in classification. A case study was carried out with the distillation process of depropanization. It is shown that the proposed hybrid model is of good performance compared to other models, in terms of the accuracy of fault detection in such a process. Also, with the increase of structural layers of the CNN–DAE model, the diagnostic accuracy will be improved, with an optimal accuracy of 92.2%. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Convolutional neural networks; Deep auto-encoders; Distillation process; Fault diagnosis","Chemical industry; Computer aided diagnosis; Convolution; Differential equations; Distillation; Distillation columns; Failure analysis; Learning systems; Neural networks; Signal encoding; Auto encoders; Convolutional neural network; Diagnostic accuracy; Distillation process; Fault diagnosis model; Liquid mixture; Optimal accuracy; Structural layers; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The identification is performed for diagnostic purposes, starting from time-domain voltage and current signals in the framework of Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) tests. Here, the sinusoidal input of the tests makes the identification of DKF parameters challenging. The paper analyzes the filter performance and proposes a possible approach to address the filter tuning to let it work with FC operating either in normal conditions or in the presence of drying and flooding fault conditions, or in fuel starvation mode. The analysis is mainly performed in a simulated environment, where the Fouquet model is used to simulate the FC. Some criteria to tune the filter are derived from the analysis and used also with experimental data produced by some EIS tests, to achieve the best estimate in constrained conditions. The results show that the DKF can be turned into a valuable tool to identify the model parameters even with signals developed for other scopes. The identification results envisage the possibility of assisting the model-based FC diagnosis by means of a very simple tool that can run on a low-cost embedded device. Indeed, the simplicity of the filter approach and a lightweight implementation allow the deployment of the algorithm in embedded solutions. © 2019 by the authors.","Diagnostic; Dual Kalman Filter; Equivalent circuit model; Fuel cell systems; Parameter identification","Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Equivalent circuits; Identification (control systems); Kalman filters; Parameter estimation; Polyelectrolytes; Spectroscopy; Time domain analysis; Constrained conditions; Diagnostic; Equivalent circuit model; Filter performance; Fuel cell system; Impedance spectroscopy; Parametric identification; Simulated environment; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the weaker intrinsic features are generally submerged in the strong noise interference and modulated to multiple frequency scales, which will weaken the extraction and identification of the transient features. To enhance the transient features, a method called time-frequency manifold image synthesis (TFMIS) is proposed in this paper. By inheriting and promoting the merits of time-frequency manifold (TFM) in feature enhancement and in-band noise suppression, the proposed method contributes on the natural compression and enhancement of the time-frequency transient features in the view of the image processing. First, the raw time-frequency image (TFI) is compressed by the 2-D discrete wavelet transform with the principal structure remained. These approximation sub-TFIs are later used to achieve a fast TFM learning process. Then, a relationship between the global TFI and the local TFM can be adaptively built by using the histogram concept with the probability distribution property demarcated. Thereupon, the proposed method can enhance a global manifold transient structure with a matching rule built from the local TFM. Consequently, by a series of inverse transformations, a TFMIS scheme is constructed for the transient feature extraction in a self-learning process. Two case studies, including bearing and gear transient feature extraction, confirm the performance of the proposed method in achieving rather high-contrast results for the natural transients, and more precise results for the fault frequency identification in detection of periodic transient signals. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Histogram matching; image compression; image synthesis; time-frequency manifold (TFM); transient feature extraction","Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Feature extraction; Graphic methods; Image enhancement; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Machinery; Probability distributions; 2-d discrete wavelet transforms; Fault diagnosis of rotating machineries; Histogram matching; Image synthesis; Inverse transformations; Machinery fault diagnosis; Time frequency manifolds (TFM); Transient features; Image compression","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The key to the fault diagnosis method based on vibration analysis is to extract state features (values or vectors) from complex vibration signals on oil tank wall. Most of the traditional state feature extraction methods choose a single measured point's vibration signal to extract its features of time domain or frequency one, and ignore vibration distribution features among various measured points. Here, amplitude barycenter and barycenter trajectory of vibration distribution were studied and analyzed from the view point of vibration barycenter to propose 4 quantized parameters. Based on these 4 quantized parameters and the support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm, the winding fault diagnosis model for power transformer based on vibration distribution features was proposed. The measurement results of actual power transformer winding fault tests and analysis ones of measured data samples acquired from more than 10 power transformers on site showed that the proposed vibration distribution features and quantized parameters can effectively reflect changes in transformer winding deformation and compression force relaxation, etc.; the winding fault diagnosis model based on vibration distribution features can also correctly detect and diagnose mechanical structure states of power transformer winding. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Vibration and Shock.

In this model, substation equipment defect state diagrams are used as the data source to solve the problems of inaccurate diagnosis caused by the sim-ilar appearance in some devices, low discrimination in various defect states, and excessive parameters in some models. Firstly, the residual network infrastructure is optimized by the convolution kernel decomposition technology to reduce the number of model parameters. Secondly, the multi-scale convolution feature fusion method is adopted to fuse the features of low layers and deep layers so as to improve the recognition accuracy of the defect state diagrams. Finally, a Bayesian optimization algorithm based on constraint improvement is proposed. Under the constraints of verification set and network volume, the self-adjustment of hyper parameters, such as the number of convolution kernels and the depth of the network, is realized to obtain a lightweight diagnostic model with optimal performance. The results show that the state recognition accuracy of improved model reaches 94.53%, which is about 3% higher than that of Alexnet and Resnet.

Scan chains are vulnerable to most manufacturing defects and process variations. Therefore, chain failures diagnosis is critical for successful yield learning. However, traditional chain diagnosis requires failing masking patterns to identify faulty chains and their fault types for designs with test compression. In other words, it cannot diagnose the chain failures which don't fail the masking chain patterns. Unfortunately, advanced FinFET technologies with more manufacturing challenges and higher process variations may result in more subtle chain timing failures which can't be detected by chain masking patterns. In this work, we present a new debugging methodology, which combines chain diagnosis and tester-based test to effectively diagnose such intermittent chain failures. The proposed methodology is validated on silicon data for one modern large SOC design and successfully identified all scan cells with hold-time issues, which were validated by STA with corrected models. The subsequent mask fixes for these identified hold-time violations resolved this yield issue and dramatically improve the yield.

Small delay fault diagnosis for yield learning faces two main challenges: (1) production test responses are usually highly compressed reducing the amount of available failure data, and (2) failure signatures not only depend on the actual defect but also on omnipresent and unknown delay variations. This work presents the very first diagnosis algorithm specifically designed to diagnose timing issues on compressed test responses and under process variations.

First, the high-dimensional process signals are normalized and then converted into images. Second, a lightweight CNN network composing of multi-layer convolution filters and sub-sampling filters is convolved with images through multiple convolution kernels, using local connections and shared weights to remove noise and interference information to obtain the high-level abstract representations of process data. Finally, a Softmax layer is used in a supervised way to implement fault diagnosis. Tennessee Eastman Process is used to verify the effectiveness of proposed model and compare the performance between the proposed model with classical classifiers and deep neural networks. The results show that the fault diagnosis accuracy is improved by converting high-dimensional process signals into images. The t-SNE visualization analysis method is used to illustrate the powerful feature extraction ability of proposed model. The features extracted by the proposed model are sent to the traditional classifiers and the accuracy of fault identification is significantly improved, which further illustrates the benefit of effective feature extraction for improving the fault diagnosis accuracy and reliability.

How to find an effective real-time model that can be applied to the UPIoT mobile terminals has become an urgent problem needing to be solved. To this end, this study proposes a lightweight convolutional neural network (LCNN) for GIS partial discharge (PD) pattern recognition using three lightweight convolutional blocks, and introduces the lowest recognition accuracy of single-class faults as the primary indicator for selecting the optimal model under the UPIoT. First, three lightweight convolutional blocks are introduced for constructing an LCNN. Then, the optimal model constructed by the lightweight blocks is sought. Next, criteria for determining the best model are introduced, and the best model under the UPIoT is selected. This study provides a reference standard for the construction of GIS PD pattern recognition under the UPIoT. Meanwhile, through the balance of evaluation indicators, this study verifies that the minimum recognition accuracy of the MnasNet model is 98.8%, which is obviously better than other methods and lays a solid foundation for GIS PD pattern recognition. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020","","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Electric switchgear; Internet of things; Partial discharges; Evaluation indicators; Feasible solution; Gas insulated switchgear(GIS); Lightweight blocks; Partial discharge pattern recognition; Real time modeling; Recognition accuracy; Reference standard; Pattern recognition","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In this research, a mechanical fault diagnosis method based on the deep learning theory and signal depth automatic compression encoder is proposed, which is a combined fault diagnosis network with feature robustness and sparse enhancement. In this network, the depth sparse automatic encoder and depth compression automatic encoder are applied at the same time, and the Softmax classifier is combined to jointly complete the three stages of signal acquisition, feature extraction, and fault recognition and diagnosis, so as to realize the effective extraction of mechanical equipment fault features. The self-designed network in this research can simultaneously improve the robustness and sparsity of the extracted features, so as to enhance its expression ability, realize the effective diagnosis of mechanical faults under time-domain signals, and fully meet the needs of fault diagnosis during the operation of complex mechanical systems. The actual bearing experimental results proves that the enhanced joint fault diagnosis network with robustness and sparsity has a diagnostic accuracy of 98% under the condition of two hidden layers. Compared with the shallow machine learning method, it is shown that the mechanical fault diagnosis method based on signal depth automatic compression encoder can effectively realize the integration and intelligence of mechanical fault feature extraction and fault diagnosis.

A mainstream application is to recognize patterns in spectrograms of faults. However, some common drawbacks still remain as following: a) Preprocess to improve the quality of spectrograms is rarely explored; b) Computing cost of a conventional CNN far exceeds the requirements of fast analysis in industry; c) Adequate labeled data cannot be acquired to train a comprehensive diagnosis model for varying working conditions.

However, sensor readings may be inaccurate due to resource-constrained devices, sensor misplacement, hardware faults, and other environmental factors. Therefore, anomaly detection is envisioned as a promising approach to deal with unreliable and malicious data injection to improve remote patient monitoring systems and reduce false medical diagnosis. In this context, several data analysis and machine learning tools have been proposed to detect abnormal deviations in WBAN. Nevertheless, no one considers the dynamic context changes of WBAN to provide adaptive and dynamic outlier detection. In addition, most of them ignore the co-existence of strong spatial and temporal correlations between monitored physiological attributes. To this end, we propose a two-level lightweight and adaptive anomaly detection approach to discard false alarms caused by faulty measurements and raise alarms only when a patient seems to be in emergency situations. In the first level, a game-theoretic technique is introduced wherein body-worn sensor nodes exploit the spatiotemporal correlation among readings to locally and adaptively detect anomalous events according to the dynamic context changes of WBAN. In the second level, we apply the Mahalanobis distance in the Local Processing Unit (LPU) which has a global view for multivariate analysis. Our main objective is to ensure a tradeoff between detection accuracy, false positive rates, and network performance while considering the WBAN environment constraints. The proposed approach is evaluated through numerical simulations on a real physiological data set. Simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of achieving high detection accuracy with low false alarm rate and energy consumption. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive anomaly detection; Game theory; Health; IoT; WBAN","Alarm systems; Data handling; Decision making; Diagnosis; Energy utilization; Errors; Fault tolerant computer systems; Game theory; Health; Internet of things; Multivariant analysis; Physiological models; Physiology; Remote patient monitoring; Sensor nodes; Wearable sensors; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Diagnostic decision makings; Physiological parameters; Remote patient monitoring systems; Resourceconstrained devices; Spatial and temporal correlation; Spatiotemporal correlation; WBAN; Wireless body area network; Anomaly detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, traditional fault diagnosis methods usually adopt manual feature extraction, which not only costs expensively and depends on prior knowledge. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the application of automatic fault identification based on the original vibration signals. Recently, existing studies have shown that most of fault diagnoses are implemented by using deep neural network. Although these methods have achieved satisfactory performances, there are obvious limitations in real applications, that is, the complexity of deep neural network requires a lot of hardware computing resources. This hinders the development of online fault diagnosis tools. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fault diagnosis model based on lightweight convolutional neural network MobileNet, and realizes an end-to-end intelligent fault classification and diagnosis application. We evaluated the proposed method with the rolling bearing dataset from Western Reserve University. The best average precision, recall and F1 score of ten different bearing health conditions are about 96%, 82% and 88%, respectively. In addition, we also compare the accuracy of the rolling bearing fault diagnosis classification model under the standard ReLU and the improved ReLU. Experimental results show that both obtain good performances, but the improved ReLU reaches the over 96% accuracy more rapidly.  © 2013 IEEE.","deep neural network; Fault diagnosis; mobilenet; rolling bearing","Computer aided diagnosis; Convolutional neural networks; Deep neural networks; Failure analysis; Roller bearings; Classification models; Fault diagnosis method; Fault diagnosis model; Fault diagnosis technology; Industrial production; Intelligent fault diagnosis; On-line fault diagnosis; Western Reserve University; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Considering the elastic deformation of tooth contact, bending, shear, axial compression and the wheel body, then the correctness of the algorithm was verified by using the finite element method. The influence of crack parameters, such as the length, depth and angle of crack, on the mesh stiffness of helical gears was analyzed. After that, a coupling dynamic model of the helical gear transmission system with crack fault was established based on the shafting element method. In this model, the factors such as the time-varying mesh stiffness, static transmission error, bearing stiffness, and the gyro force of gear rotor were taken into consideration. The dynamic characteristics of the system were analyzed by the Newmark-β method, then the effect of crack parameters on the vibration response of the system was studied. It is shown that the mesh stiffness of gears decreases with the depth and the length of the crack. There are some periodic impulses in the time domain. Moreover, the mesh frequency modulated sideband appears in the frequency domain.

At present, networks of intelligent wireless sensors are pervasive, finding success in many environments and industries, including the railways. However, when it comes to data-intensive applications like vibration monitoring that require the delivery of large amounts of records, the limitations of these devices arise. The shortfalls are mainly driven by the low-bandwidth transmission capacity of their radio interfaces, and the low-power features of their battery-operated (and/or energy-harvested) electronics. In sight of these limited resources, this article explores a vibration data compression strategy for diagnosis purposes. To maximise the amount of transferred information with the least amount of bytes this method works in three stages: first, it extracts the most useful features for vibration-based analytics. Then, it compresses the raw signal waveform using an Autoencoder neural network with an undercomplete representation, assessing its optimum regularisation approach: the denoising, sparse, and contractive configurations. Finally, it reduces the resolution of the compressed data by quantising all the resulting real values into single-byte unsigned integers. The proposed strategy is evaluated with a dataset of railway axle bearings with different levels of degradation. The results of the analysis show that with compression rates up to 10 the vibration signals are practically unaffected by this procedure, and once the signals are reconstructed with a minimum quality standard, many diagnosis goals like anomaly detection, fault location, and severity appraisal can be performed. This approach yields a wide range of business opportunities for on-board predictive maintenance with IIoT technology. © 2020 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

The daily detection of the internal hazard defects of the wheels in the running parts relies on a professional trackside fault online diagnosis system based on the ultrasonic sensor probe array data. However, the on-line ultrasonic diagnosis of EMU wheels is usually accompanied by various interference noises. The defect echo signals collected by the sensor probe array are weak and are easily submerged by noise, which makes it impossible to perform effective defect identification. This paper proposes an improved threshold function to overcome the discontinuous shortcomings of the classical wavelet soft threshold function and hard threshold function in view of the non-stationary characteristics of the ultrasonic detection signal of the EMU wheels. This paper proposes a sine-type threshold processing function. It is characterized by adopting gradual compression processing to denoise the echo signal of the ultrasonic sensor probe array. In order to verify the validity, the continuity at the threshold is observed through the linear space vector signal, and the algorithm is simulated and tested through the three-dimensional Gaussian echo mathematical model of the ultrasonic signal and the measured ultrasonic envelope signal. Experimental results show that the improved threshold function can suppress the noise in the ultrasonic echo data, improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and retain the waveform characteristics of the defect signal, which is conducive to defect recognition.  © 2013 IEEE.","EMU wheel; fault diagnosis; threshold denoising; ultrasonic data; wavelet transform","Defects; Electric railroads; Fault detection; Probes; Signal to noise ratio; Three dimensional computer graphics; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonic sensors; Ultrasonic testing; Vector spaces; Wheels; Defect identification; Electric multiple unit; Fault diagnosis systems; Non stationary characteristics; Soft threshold function; Threshold processing; Ultrasonic detection; Waveform characteristics; Signal denoising","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Thus, accurate fault diagnoses of bearing elements are essential for proactive predictive maintenance. However, the using of multiple sensors with high sampling rate reveal considerable shortages in the analysis of big data acquisition. Therefore, compressive sensing (CS) proposes in this study to overcome the aforementioned problems and support the fault diagnostic approach of ball bearing defects. The amount of data processed by CS technique can be significantly reduced to be more reliable for backup data. It can be a collaborative reconstruction method to compress the sampling data size and reliably exploiting similar sparsity structure of the acquired signal. Little attention has been paid for practically used sparseness of the CS converted signal in early fault detection of defects in ball bearing. Envelope analysis and CS technique are employed on experimental vibration data for fault detection in inner race and outer race of ball bearing. The results show that the reconstructed CS signal can characterize reliable features for bearing fault detection with some limitations in the range of compression ratio (up to 40%) and the selection of reconstructed sparse bandwidth. Hence, envelope analysis can provide optimal bandwidth to reconstruct the sparse modulated signal of ball bearing to overcome the limitation of the CS method. © 2020 ASTES Publishers.

For a sound decision on occurred faults, typically a large amount of sensor measurements and state variables has to be gathered, analyzed and evaluated in real-time. Due to the complexity and the nature of distributed systems all this data needs to be communicated among the network, which is an expensive affair in terms of communication resources and time. In this paper we present compression strategies that utilize the fact that many of these data streams are highly correlated and can be compressed simultaneously. Experimental results show that this can lead to better compression ratios compared to an individual compression of the data streams. Moreover, the algorithms support real-time constraints for time-triggered architectures and enable the data to be transmitted by means of shorter messages, leading to a reduced communication time and improved scheduling results. With an example data set we show that, depending on the parameters of the compression algorithm, more than one third of the bits (34.3%) in the data communication can be saved while only on about 0.2% of all data values a slight loss of accuracy occurs. This means 99.8% of the data values can be correctly delivered without any loss but with a significant reduction of bandwidth demands. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Data compression; Online-diagnosis; Real-time; Scheduling","Data compression ratio; Distributed database systems; Online systems; Automatic monitoring; Communication resources; Compression algorithms; Compression strategies; On-line fault diagnosis; Real time constraints; Sensor measurements; Time-triggered architectures; Data streams","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, most of the existing methods are based on single-task learning. Fault diagnosis task (FDT) is treated as an independent task, and rich correlation information contained in different tasks is ignored. Therefore, this article explores the possibility of using speed identification task (SIT) and load identification task (LIT) as two auxiliary tasks to improve the performance of the FDT and proposes a multitask one-dimensional convolutional neural network (MT-1DCNN). Specifically, the MT-1DCNN utilizes trunk network to learn shared features required for every task and then processes different tasks through multiple task-specific branches. In this way, the MT-1DCNN can utilize features learned by related tasks to improve the performance of the FDT. The experimental results with wheelset bearing data set show that the multitask learning can make full use of the feature information captured by the SIT and the LIT to improve the fault diagnosis performance of the network, and the MT-1DCNN has a better performance than five excellent networks in accuracy.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Bearing fault diagnosis; convolutional neural network (CNN); multitask learning (MTL); vibration analysis","Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Learning systems; Multi-task learning; Wheels; Bearing fault diagnosis; Diagnosis performance; Feature information; Independent tasks; Load identification; Multiple tasks; Single task learning; Speed identification; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Precise detection and diagnosis of failures or faults in WSN is a challenging issue due to the diversity of deployment and the limitations in the sensors’ resources. In this paper, supervised machine learning-based technique is considered to scrutinize the behavior of sensors through their data for the detection and diagnosis of faults. Most of the faults that commonly occur in WSN are considered: hardover, drift, spike, erratic, data-loss, stuck, and random fault. A trusted dataset published online by the researchers at the University of North Carolina composed of temperature and humidity sensor measurements of multi-hop scenario was acquired and the aforementioned faults were simulated in non-faulty (normal) data. Events from fault occurrences were generated to replicate realistic scenarios of WSN. To detect and diagnose the faults in timely manner, we adopt an ensemble learning-based lightweight technique called Extremely Randomized Trees or Extra-Trees. The proposed Extra-Trees-based detection scheme has the ability of robustness towards signal noise and strong reduction of bias and variance error. The performances of the proposed scheme were compared with those of the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, random forest, neural network, and decision tree. Performance evaluation shows the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of accuracy, precision, and F1-score. In addition, the proposed scheme has low training time compared to state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Extremely Randomized Trees; Fault diagnosis; Machine learning; Wireless Sensor Networks","Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Wireless sensor networks; Bias and variance; Detection and diagnosis; Ensemble learning; Realistic scenario; State-of-the-art approach; Supervised machine learning; Temperature and humidity sensor; University of North Carolina; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In both approaches, selecting the relevant measurements or extracting important features from historical data is a key determiner of the success of the algorithm. Recently, deep learning methods have been effective in automating the feature selection process. Autoencoders have been shown to be an effective neural network configuration for extracting features from complex data, however, they may also learn irrelevant features. In addition, end-to-end classification neural networks have also been used for diagnosis, but like autoencoders, this method may also learn unimportant features thus making the diagnostic inference scheme inefficient. To rapidly extract significant fault features, this paper employs end-to-end networks and develops a new feature extraction method based on importance analysis and knowledge distilling. First, a set of cumbersome neural network models are trained to predict faults and some of their internal values are defined as features. Then an occlusion-based importance analysis method is developed to select the most relevant input variables and learned features. Finally, a simple student neural network model is designed based on the previous analysis results and an improved knowledge distilling method is proposed to train the student model. Because of the way the cumbersome networks are trained, only fault features are learned, with the importance analysis further pruning the relevant feature set. These features can be rapidly generated by the student model. We discuss the algorithms, and then apply our method to two typical dynamic systems, a communication system and a 10-tank system employed to demonstrate the proposed approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fault diagnosis; Feature learning; Knowledge distilling; Neural networks","Computer aided diagnosis; Data mining; Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Machine learning; Neural networks; Students; Diagnostic inferences; Extracting features; Feature extraction methods; Feature learning; Importance analysis; Knowledge distilling; Neural network configurations; Neural network model; Feature extraction","Article","Final","","Scopus"

However, the number of labeled bearing fault samples is limited in industrial practice, and these samples usually are contained with complex environmental noise. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a generalizable DL model with strong feature learning ability. To tackle the above challenges, this article proposes a multiscale lightweight fault diagnosis model based on the idea of adversarial learning. The multiscale feature extraction unit is applied to the vibration signal for learning complementary and abundant fault information at different time scales, increasing the width and reducing the depth of the network. Meanwhile, a novel easy-to-train module based on the idea of adversarial learning is utilized to strengthen the feature learning ability by competitive optimization. Besides, the depthwise separable convolution is introduced to reduce the size of the network and achieve the lightweight design. These measures strengthen the feature learning ability and generalization of proposed method, and further ensure its noise robustness in the case of limited samples. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been verified on two bearing datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed method is robust to noise in the case of limited samples.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Adversarial learning; attention mechanism; convolutional neural network (CNN); fault diagnosis","Deep learning; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Adversarial learning; Different time scale; Environmental noise; Fault diagnosis model; Industrial practices; Lightweight design; Multi-scale features; Vibration signal; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus"

These vectors are used as input of the machine learning technique in order to discriminate among several machine conditions, such as normal, pressure reduction in the intake manifold, compression ratio and amount of fuel injected reduction into the cylinders.

The chips in question are extracted from wafers and re-tested on a debug platform to arrive at a reasonable number of probable defect candidates that can be physically analyzed. This requires a large setup time and multiple iterations of deterministic diagnostic test pattern generation and application. In every iteration, offline software tools are used to diagnose observed failures and generate the needed new patterns to prune the list of defect candidates. In this paper, we propose an online approach for generating additional diagnostic patterns for the hard-to-diagnose chips without moving them to the debug platform. We generate these patterns directly on the tester through a fault model independent hardware-in-the-loop evolutionary algorithm. This algorithm is guided by a lightweight fitness metric that is solely based on the mismatches observed by applying the newly generated patterns to a pair of circuits consisting of a known good die and the chip being diagnosed. We evaluated our technique by comparing our results against a state-of-the-art commercial diagnostic pattern generation tool. Using our generated patterns, we were able to match the diagnosis quality of the commercial tool, while incurring significantly less runtime than the commercial tool on average. Our technique also eliminates the setup and other overhead costs of offline iterative diagnosis, which amounts to additional time savings. © 2016 IEEE.","","Defects; Embedded systems; Hardware; Silicon wafers; Synthetic apertures; Diagnostic test generation; Diagnostic test pattern generations; Hard-ware-in-the-loop; Hardware in the loop modeling; Multiple iterations; Off-line softwares; Pattern Generation; State of the art; Iterative methods","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

In this paper, an innovative method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence for detecting incipient anomalies in highly correlated multivariate data is presented. We use a partial least square (PLS) method as a modeling framework and a symmetrized Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) as an anomaly indicator, where it is used to quantify the dissimilarity between current PLS-based residual and reference probability distributions obtained using fault-free data. Furthermore, this paper reports the development of two monitoring charts based on the KLD. The first approach is a KLD-Shewhart chart, where the Shewhart monitoring chart with a three sigma rule is used to monitor the KLD of the response variables residuals from the PLS model. The second approach integrates the KLD statistic into the exponentially weighted moving average monitoring chart. The performance of the PLS-based KLD anomaly-detection methods is illustrated and compared to that of conventional PLS-based anomaly detection methods. Using synthetic data and simulated distillation column data, we demonstrate the greater sensitivity and effectiveness of the developed method over the conventional PLS-based methods, especially when data are highly correlated and small anomalies are of interest. Results indicate that the proposed chart is a very promising KLD-based method because KLD-based charts are, in practice, designed to detect small shifts in process parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anomaly detection; Kullback-Leibler distance; Partial least square; Statistical process control","Control charts; Distillation columns; Probability distributions; Signal detection; Statistical process control; Anomaly detection; Anomaly detection methods; Exponentially weighted moving average; Kullback Leibler divergence; Kullback-Leibler distance; Partial least square (PLS); Reliability and safeties; Simulated distillation; Least squares approximations","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Fault diagnosis deliveries significant benefits to machines with rolling element bearings by finding the faults at early period and taking corrective actions to enhance safe and high performance operations. However, multiple sensor usages and high rate data acquisition involved in a monitoring system have considerable drawbacks of high system cost involved in purchasing hardware for data transfer, storage and processing. To reduce these shortages, this paper investigates compressive sensing (CS) techniques for the fault detection of rolling element bearings. Based on the frequency shift and envelope analysis, a CS scheme is developed for monitoring the bearing. The number of data transmitted and stored can be reduced by several thousands of times. The simulation and the experimental results demonstrate that the compressed vibration signals of rolling element bearings are effective to detect bearing faults at the total compressing ratio up to several thousand with the corresponding maximum compression ratio (CR) of CS process at nearly 100. In addition, several performance measures are applied to evaluate the reconstructed signals and show approximately the information about the noise level of the system. © 2017 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK - CACSUK.","Compressive sensing; Frequency shift; Reconstruction; Rolling element bearings","Automation; Bearings (machine parts); Compressed sensing; Data acquisition; Data transfer; Digital storage; Fault detection; Image reconstruction; Machine components; Compressive sensing; Corrective actions; Frequency shift; High rate data acquisition; High-performance operation; Monitoring system; Performance measure; Rolling Element Bearing; Roller bearings","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Instantaneous angular speed (IAS) analysis is one of a few non-intrusive condition monitoring techniques that could be applied for such tasks. This method needs only a non-intrusive speed sensor (magnetic or optical) signal to assess in details the mechanical behaviour of an engine and diagnose injection, compression, or valve state defaults, and bearings/moving parts damages. The method is able to point out the exact cylinder which is in defect using additional order tracking speed sensor (TDC or cam). The technique is more suitable and efficient for mass industry deployments than other non-intrusive methods such as vibration and acoustic emissions. A combination of instantaneous angular speed analysis based on Hilbert transform associated with order analysis and statistical moments is used and give detailed and robust diagnosis. The system is used on a cogeneration plant to monitor GE/JENBACHER gas engines, emergency diesel engines, fleet locomotives, and military/ferry boats. It is also currently tested on emergency diesel engines in EDF nuclear power plants.","Diagnosis; Engines; Instantaneous angular speed","Acoustic emission testing; Bearings (machine parts); Cogeneration plants; Condition monitoring; Diagnosis; Engine pistons; Engines; Gas engines; Gears; Mathematical transformations; Monitoring; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Speed; Valves (mechanical); Continuous monitoring; Functional failure; Hilbert transform; Instantaneous angular speed; Mechanical behaviour; Monitoring techniques; Non-intrusive method; Statistical moments; Diesel engines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

However, nearly all of such algorithms are optimized for platform-based performance and may not be useful for diverse and flexible applications. The National Security Agency (NSA) has proposed two relatively recent families of lightweight ciphers, that is, Simon and Speck, designed as efficient ciphers on both hardware and software platforms. This article proposes concurrent error detection schemes to provide reliable architectures for these two families of lightweight block ciphers. The research work on analyzing the reliability of these algorithms and providing fault diagnosis approaches has not been undertaken to date to the best of our knowledge. The main aim of the proposed reliable architectures is to provide high error coverage while maintaining acceptable area and power consumption overheads. To achieve this, we propose a variant of recomputing with encoded operands. These low-complexity schemes are suited for low-resource applications such as sensitive, constrained implantable and wearable medical devices. We perform fault simulations for the proposed architectures by developing a fault model framework. The architectures are simulated and analyzed on recent field-programmable grate array (FPGA) platforms, and it is shown that the proposed schemes provide high error coverage. The proposed low-complexity concurrent error detection schemes are a step forward toward more reliable architectures for Simon and Speck algorithms in lightweight, secure applications. © 2017 ACM.","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA); Low complexity; Reliability; Simon; Speck","Biomedical equipment; Convolutional codes; Cryptography; Diagnosis; Error detection; Errors; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware security; National security; Reliability; Concurrent error detection schemes; Lightweight architecture; Lightweight block ciphers; Low complexity; National security agencies; Simon; Speck; Wearable medical devices; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In order to increase the energy performance of these systems during part-load operation, variable-speed compressors and fans have been adopted in the last two decades. However, profitable energy saving could be achieved not only by optimizing the design and the control of these systems, but also by scheduling a proper maintenance strategy. In fact, if not properly maintained, no benefits would be achieved even when more sophisticated systems are adopted. In order to support plant owners in scheduling cost-effective maintenance program, Fault Detection and Diagnosis techniques could represent promising tools for monitoring the performance over time. However, only fixed-speed air-conditioning systems have been considered during these years. This work aims at providing insights into the effects of common faults such as condenser fouling, evaporator fouling and charge faults in variable-speed direct expansion systems. To this aim, the analysis was based on an intensive experimental campaign carried out on a 17.5 kW rooftop unit installed at Herrick Laboratories, Purdue University (USA). Results allowed for describing the response of the investigated rooftop unit in terms of pressures, temperature and power consumption and so forth when considering full-load and part-load operation for faults-free and faulty operating condition. These results will orient the development of innovative Fault Detection and Diagnostic techniques for these systems. © ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.

The model is introduced into Workbench so that the modal analysis can be carried out. The results are compared with the experimental results to verify the correctness of the model. Sinusoidal acceleration is applied on the model to carry out the harmonic response analysis. According to the changes of vibration signals collected on the top and at the front of each phase, the looseness threshold can be set. In the experiment, the winding looseness can be preliminary located by using the variance ratio of the specific value. The proportion of fundamental frequency component to the total component is compared with the ratio under the rated pre-compression to determine the loose phase. It is founded that the variation of fundamental frequency component of C phase at the top of test transformer is greater than the top threshold 0.78, and the variation at the front is greater than 0.44, which means the C phase is seriously loose. The variance ratios on the top and at the front of normal phases are less than the thresholds at each position, in which the variation of winding far away from the loose phase is less than 0.03. Therefore, the method can locate the defect of winding looseness. © 2016, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPI.

It might reduce generous requirements of data acquisition, transmission and storage hardware. Aiming at the signals from the compression perception within the framework, this paper proposed a new method for rolling bearing fault diagnoses. In this method, part of hadamard matrix was chosen as a measurement matrix, and kurtosis factor, variance and waveform factor as a sensitive parameters. So there was no need to rebuild compression measurement and the gathering informations were utilized to extract sensitive characteristics directly, and then the PSO-SVM algorithm was used for pattern recognition so as to realize fault diagnoses. It is shown that within a certain range compression ratio, the method may use less amount of data of fault characteristics for rolling bearing fault diagnoses. © 2017, China Mechanical Engineering Magazine Office.

It is also essential for improving product quality and reducing production cost by reducing process downtime. Real-time multiscale classification of faults plays a vital role in process monitoring. However, some major issues such as high correlation, complexity, and nonlinearity of data are yet to be addressed. In this paper, a fault diagnosis approach based on multikernel support vector machines is proposed to classify the internal and external faults such as reflux failure, change in reboiler duty, column tray upsets, and change in feed composition, flow, and temperature in a distillation column. The data set is generated using Aspen plus dynamics simulation at normal and faulty states. The classification has been done by various methods such as decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, artificial neural network, subspace discriminant, and multikernel support vector machine. It is observed that the SVM based diagnostic system provides more accurate root cause isolation. The proposed MK-SVM method was evaluated by using the confusion matrix as the performance evaluator. The result showed that the proposed model has a high FDR which is 99.77% and a very low FAR, i.e., 0.23%. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","","Accident prevention; Computer software; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Distillation columns; Electric fault currents; Failure analysis; Image retrieval; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Process control; Process monitoring; Support vector machines; Confusion matrices; Dynamics simulation; Fault detection and diagnosis; In-process monitoring; K-nearest neighbors; Linear discriminant analysis; Multiple fault diagnosis; Performance evaluator; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

This work is placed in the context of detection and diagnosis of the operating faults of an industrial installation. Indeed, the installation in this study is a Methylcyclohexane continuous column from a mixture of toluene/methylcyclohexane in which the mass composition was defined to 23% of methylcyclohexane. The studied system, allows the separation of the more volatile component which is methylcyclohexane contained in the liquid mixture. We use K-means clustering technique combined with wavelet transform for noise reduction in order to determine precisely data mapping to different classes of faults in the distillation column. This approach is compared with the exclusive use of K-means and its classification accuracy is proved. The developed technique is implemented and tested against a dataset, which covers two modes of operation of the distillation column: the normal mode, and the abnormal mode. The latter mode is represented by the four most common dysfunctions of the distillation column. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Clustering; Continuous distillation column; Continuous wavelet transform; Detection and diagnosis; K-Means","Fault detection; Mixtures; Noise abatement; Wavelet transforms; Clustering; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Detection and diagnosis; Fault detection and diagnosis; Industrial installations; K-means; K-means clustering techniques; Stationary wavelet transforms; Distillation columns","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

A wide range of criteria should be taken into account when designing lightweight ciphers, such as both the linear and non-linear properties, and resilience to active side-channel attacks (SCA), e.g., fault analysis attacks mounted on VLSI implementations. This paper motivates the urgency and highlights the importance of considering reliability and error detection as a design factor beforehand rather than an afterthought. In this paper and through case studies, we motivate the urgency of “design-for low-cost reliability and fault diagnosis” for future work to thwart fault analysis attacks “before” the algorithms are designed. In this paper, we focus on the design criteria of S-boxes transformations (we note that for different ciphers, these transformations might be denoted by other yet similar terms), which provide diffusion and confusion properties in block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hash functions. We also present the results of our implementations for a set of S-boxes used in various block ciphers benchmarked on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).

Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) have been increasingly used to fabricate wind turbine blades. Delamination-type damage is inevitable during manufacture or in-service of a CFRP blade. This inner (subsurface) flaw, usually difficult to be detected by artificial visual inspection or machine vision based on CCD or CMOS, severely degrades the load-bearing capacity of a blade. Induction infrared thermography (IIT) is an emerging infrared machine vision inspection technology, which has the capability of insight to CFRP based on electromagnetic induction and heat conduction. This paper introduces photothermal thermal-wave radar (TWR) nondestructive imaging (NDI) to IIT, based on cross-correlation (CC) pulse compression and matched filtering and applies TWR principles to CFRP imaging inspection and diagnosis. The experimental studies carried out under the transmission mode have shown that TWR B-scan and phasegram can be used to inspect and diagnose subsurface delaminations in CFRP with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and shape identification. As a new machine vision inspection method, TWRI will play an important role in the OCM of the wind turbine blade. © 2018 IEEE.","Blade; diagnosis; imaging inspection; induction infrared thermography; machine vision; nondestructive infrared imaging; on-condition maintenance; Thermal-Wave Radar NDI; thermographic analysis; wind turbine","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Computer vision; Condition monitoring; Delamination; Diagnosis; Electromagnetic induction; Fault detection; Fiber reinforced plastics; Heat conduction; Imaging techniques; Inspection; Maintainability; Maintenance; Nondestructive examination; Radar imaging; Radar signal processing; Thermal Engineering; Turbine components; Turbomachine blades; Wind power; Wind turbines; Blade; Blades; Heating system; Imaging inspection; Non destructive; On-condition maintenances; Thermal wave; Thermographic analysis; Thermography (imaging)","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is considered the best among all battery types and cells because of its superior characteristics and performance. The positive environmental impacts and recycling potential of lithium batteries have influenced the development of new research for improving Li-ion battery technologies. However, the cost reduction, safe operation, and mitigation of negative ecological impacts are now a common concern for advancement. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the state of the art of Li-ion batteries including the fundamentals, structures, and overall performance evaluations of different types of lithium batteries. A study on a battery management system for Li-ion battery storage in EV applications is demonstrated, which includes a cell condition monitoring, charge, and discharge control, states estimation, protection and equalization, temperature control and heat management, battery fault diagnosis, and assessment aimed at enhancing the overall performance of the system. It is observed that the Li-ion batteries are becoming very popular in vehicle applications due to price reductions and lightweight with high power density. However, the management of the charging and discharging processes, CO2 and greenhouse gases emissions, health effects, and recycling and refurbishing processes have still not been resolved satisfactorily. Consequently, this review focuses on the many factors, challenges, and problems and provides recommendations for sustainable battery manufacturing for future EVs.

According to compressed sensing, the original signal was sparsely represented by orthogonal basis. Then, the Gaussian matrix was used as the measurement matrix to compress the original signal, the remote transmission of the compressed data was realized by means of the Socket communication technology and TCP/IP network protocol. Moreover, the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm was used as reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct the compression signal, the reconstruction value of original signal was obtained by the inverse sparse transformation. Finally on the hydraulic pump fault simulation test bench, the remote fault diagnosis experiment of single slipper wear and single loose slipper are experimented.

Addressing faults in industrial processes, coupled with the growing demand for higher performance, improved safety and reliability necessitates implementation of less complex alternative control strategies in the events of malfunctions in actuators, sensors and or other system components. This work demonstrates frugality in the design and implementation of fault tolerant control system by integrating fault detection and diagnosis techniques with simple active restructurable feedback controllers and with backup feedback signals and switchable reference points to accommodate actuator fault in distillation columns based on a priori assessed control structures. A multivariate statistical process monitoring based fault detection and diagnosis technique through dynamic principal components analysis is integrated with one-point control or alternative control structure for prompt and effective fault detection, isolation and accommodation. The work also investigates effects of disturbances on fault propagation and detection. Specifically, the reflux and vapor boil-up control strategy used for a binary distillation column during normal operation is switched to one point control of the more valued product by utilizing the remaining healthy actuator. The proposed approach was implemented on two distillation processes: a simulated methanol-water separation column and the benchmark Shell standard heavy oil fractionation process to assess its effectiveness. © 2017, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","distillation column; Dynamic principal component analysis; fault detection and diagnosis; fault tolerant controller; inferential control","Accident prevention; Actuators; Controllers; Crude oil; Distillation; Fault detection; Fault tolerance; Feedback; Fractionation; Heavy oil production; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Process monitoring; Statistical process control; Binary distillation columns; Dynamic principal component analysis; Fault detection and diagnosis; Fault tolerant control systems; Fault tolerant controllers; Inferential control; Multivariate statistical process monitoring; Principal components analysis; Distillation columns","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Direct model-based fault diagnosis methods often prove to be time-consuming because they iteratively solve the direct model to obtain representative disturbance parameters. In this paper, an inversion method is proposed for identifying fault causes in the field of distillation diagnosis by mapping measured data against disturbance types. The proposed method consists of an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, both normal and abnormal samples are simulated based on a simplified dynamic mechanistic model, and they are used to establish an inversion model for each disturbance with regard to each characteristic representation quantity using a genetic algorithm (GA). In the online phase, neural network, negative selection algorithm (NSA), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms are used to determine the disturbance type, and the disturbance quantity is obtained by solving the corresponding inversion model. The proposed method is applied to high purity binary distillation column and benzene–toluene distillation column test cases. Case studies demonstrate that the inversion model-based diagnosis method can effectively identify disturbances and thus provide theoretical support for the application of quantitative fault diagnosis technology in the chemical industry. © 2017 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2017 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","distillation; disturbance; inversion; quantitative identification","Benzene refining; Chemical industry; Distillation; Distillation columns; Failure analysis; Genetic algorithms; Iterative methods; Support vector machines; Binary distillation columns; disturbance; Disturbance parameters; Fault diagnosis technology; inversion; Negative selection algorithm; Quantitative identification; Support vector machine algorithm; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Gamma-ray scanning is one of the most common techniques that is used in industrial radioisotopes applications. It is used to get signals that reflect the inner details of a distillation column. These signals are gamma intensity variation that comes from material density variation in the column. In the proposed approach, the signals of each distillation column are divided into frames. Each frame contains the signal of just one column tray. Therefore, the position of the defected tray can be determined exactly in the column. Discrete wavelet transform, power density spectrum, higher order statistics (HOS), area under the curve (AUC) and correlation between signals are features that are extracted to be used in artificial neural network.

Maintenance of this machinery is very expensive, mainly due to large downtime and repair cost. While much attention has been given to detect faults in these mechanical devices, real-time fault diagnosis for streaming vibration data from turbine gearboxes is still an outstanding challenge. Moreover, monitoring gearboxes in a wind farm with thousands of wind turbines require massive computational power. In this paper, we propose a three-layer monitoring system: Sensor, Fog, and Cloud layers. Each layer provides a special functionality and runs part of the proposed data processing pipeline. In the Sensor layer, vibration data is collected using accelerometers. Industrial single chip computers are best candidates for node computation. Since the majority of wind turbines are installed in harsh environments, sensor node computers should be embedded within wind turbines. Therefore, a robust computation platform is necessary for sensor nodes. In this layer, we propose a novel feature extraction method which is applied over a short window of vibration data. Using a time-series model assumption, our method estimates vibration power at high resolution and low cost. Fog layer provides Internet connectivity. Fog-server collects data from sensor nodes and sends them to the cloud. Since many wind farms are located in remote locations, providing network connectivity is challenging and expensive. Sometimes a wind farm is offshore and a satellite connection is the only solution. In this regard, we use a compressive sensing algorithm by deploying them on fog-servers to conserve communication bandwidth. Cloud layer performs most computations. In the online mode, after decompression, fault diagnosis is performed using trained classifier, while generating reports and logs. Whereas, in the offline mode, model training for classifier, parameters learning for feature extraction in sensor layer and dictionary learning for compression on fog servers and decompression are performed. The proposed architecture monitors the health of turbines in a scalable framework by leveraging the distributed computation techniques. Our empirical evaluation of vibration datasets obtained from real wind turbines demonstrates high scalability and performance of diagnosing gearbox failures, i.e., with an accuracy greater than 99%, for application in large wind farms. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data analytics; Fault diagnosis; Gearbox; Industrial internet of things; Signal processing; Vibration; Wind turbine","Big data; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Data Analytics; Data handling; Electric utilities; Extraction; Failure analysis; Feature extraction; Fog; Gears; Large dataset; Offshore oil well production; Pipeline processing systems; Repair; Sensor nodes; Signal processing; Vibration analysis; Wind power; Wind turbines; Communication bandwidth; Data processing pipelines; Distributed computations; Feature extraction methods; Gearbox; Real-time fault diagnosis; Three layer monitoring system; Vibration; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The need to detect and localize the occurrence of faults at runtime is steadily becoming imperative. In this work, we propose NoCAlert, a comprehensive online and real-time fault detection and localization mechanism that demonstrates 0% false negatives within the interconnect for the fault models and stimulus set used in this study. Based on the concept of invariance checking, NoCAlert employs a group of lightweight microchecker modules that collectively implement real-time hardware assertions. The checkers operate concurrently with normal NoC operation, thus eliminating the need for periodic, or triggered-based, self-testing. Based on the pattern/signature of asserted checkers, NoCAlert can pinpoint the location of the fault at various granularity levels. Most important, 97% of the transient and 90% of the permanent faults are detected instantaneously, within a single clock cycle upon fault manifestation. The fault localization accuracy ranges from 90% to 100%, depending on the desired localization granularity. Extensive cycle-accurate simulations in a 64-node CMP and analysis at the RTL netlist-level demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed technique. © 2016 ACM.","Fault detection/diagnosis; Fault localization; Networks-on-chip; NoC","Computer architecture; Distributed computer systems; Embedded systems; Fault detection; Cycle-accurate simulation; Fault detection/diagnosis; Fault localization; Granularity levels; Network-on-chip architectures; Networks on chips; Real time fault detection; Single-clock-cycle; Network-on-chip","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

In thismethod, different signal frequency bands are processed by rescaling subsampling compression to make each frequency band meet the conditions of stochastic resonance. Before the enhanced signal components are synthesized, they are processed to achieve the enhanced signal by means of AMD, leaving only the enhanced sections of the signal.The processed signal is decomposed into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) by VMD, in order to require the detection of weak multifrequency signals.

Due to the high quality of bio-medical videos and the subsequent large volumes of data generated, to enable medical diagnosis on-the-go it is imperative to efficiently transcode and stream the stored videos on real time, without quality loss. However, online video transcoding is a high-demanding computationally-intensive task and its efficient management in Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chip (MPSoCs) poses an important challenge. In this work, we propose an efficient motion- and texture-aware frame-level parallelization approach to enable online medical imaging transcoding on MPSoCs for next generation video encoders. By exploiting the unique characteristics of bio-medical videos and the medical procedure that enable diagnosis, we split frames into tiles based on their motion and texture, deciding the most adequate level of parallelization. Then, we employ the available encoding parameters to satisfy the required video quality and compression. Moreover, we propose a new fast motion search algorithm for bio-medical videos that allows to drastically reduce the computational complexity of the encoder, thus achieving the frame rates required for online transcoding. Finally, we heuristically allocate the threads to the most appropriate available resources and set the operating frequency of each one. We evaluate our work on an enterprise multicore server achieving online medical imaging with 1.6x higher throughput and 44% less power consumption when compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. © 2018 EDAA.","","Diagnosis; Fault tolerance; Green computing; Image coding; Medical imaging; Multiprocessing systems; Online systems; Signal encoding; System-on-chip; Bio-medical image processing; Efficient managements; Encoding parameters; Medical diagnostics; Multiprocessor systems on chips; Operating frequency; State-of-the-art techniques; Workload allocation; Video signal processing","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, as the process technology continues to scale from 28 nm to 10nm FinFET, challenges arisen during FA, as the conventional electrical fault isolation tools reach the limit of optical resolution; while new test strategies are concurrently being introduced. Furthermore, the rising complexity and depth of logic, combined with the high compression ratio of the DFT scan architecture, makes fault diagnostics even more challenging and unreliable. This work will highlight some of the major challenges faced in the introduction of 10nm technology. It includes the intricacies of DFT fault diagnostics and the increasing limitations in electrical fault isolation, as the current available tools reach their minimum detection limits. This paper will present an innovative technique in performing fault isolation in our latest 10nm product to resolve 35% yield loss due to stuck-at-fault (SAF) logic failures during first silicon bring up. The biggest issue faced during debug apart from the fact that the devices were failing across all voltages and frequencies was lack of good diagnostics data that could lead to a viable suspect location.

AAS usually rely on tests results to check the program's functional correctness to provide feedback to students. Novice programmers, however, may find it difficult to map such feedback to the root failures' cause in their programs. It can be even more frustrating when the code is ""almost right"". In this paper we investigated the use of a fault localization technique on programs produced by students of introductory programming. Our proposed approach is grounded on spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL). The results of our empirical study showed that this lightweight technique is promising. It can be easily adapted to different AAS to generate useful feedback not only to students but also to instructors. We also delineate the scope where SBFL use is jeopardized. The main contribution of this paper is to present the benefits and drawbacks of applying SBFL, in the context of programming learning, as a novel source of information about students' programming assignments faults. © 2016 IEEE.","Automated assessment; Experimentation; Novices; Programming; Software fault diagnosis","Atomic absorption spectrometry; Education; Fault detection; Mathematical programming; Software testing; Students; Automated assessment; Experimentation; Functional correctness; Introductory programming; Introductory programming course; Novices; Programming assignments; Software fault diagnosis; Program diagnostics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The fault in one process variable readily affects all the other associated variables, which makes the fault detection process not only more difficult but also time-consuming. In this study, principal component analysis (PCA)-based fault amplification algorithm is developed to detect both the root cause of fault and the fault propagation path in the system. The developed algorithm projects the samples on the residual subspace (RS) to determine the disturbance propagation path. Usually, the RS of the fault data is superimposed with the normal process variations, which should be minimized to amplify the fault magnitude. The RS-containing amplified fault is then converted to the covariance matrix, followed by singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis, which, in turn, generates the fault direction matrix corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. The fault variables are then rearranged according to their magnitude of contribution toward a fault, which, in turn, represents the fault propagation path using an absolute descending order function. Moreover, the multivariate Granger causality (MVGC) algorithm is used to analyze the causal relationship among the variables obtained from the developed algorithm. Both the methodologies are tested on the LNG fractionation process train and distillation column operation, where some fault case scenarios are assumed to estimate the fault directions. It is observed that the hierarchy of variables obtained from fault propagation path algorithm are in good agreement with the MVGC algorithm. Therefore, fault amplification methodology can be used in industrial systems for identifying the root cause of fault, as well as the fault propagation path. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","","Covariance matrix; Distillation columns; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Process monitoring; Singular value decomposition; Statistical tests; Causal relationships; Development industry; Fault-detection process; Fractionation process; Industrial systems; Largest eigenvalues; Residual subspaces; Statistical methodologies; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"

A data compression denoising method based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm is proposed according to the weak and large disturbances of large motor PD signals. A simulation model is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the denoising effect of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of the db2 and db8 wavelets in the experiments. The simulation and experimental results show that a data compression denoising algorithm based on EMD can achieve the same denoising effect with those based on db2 and db8 wavelets. The proposed algorithm is even better in terms of relative error and mean square error. For actual signal processing, the data compression denoising algorithm is better than the other algorithms and does not lose the original signal energy. The PD ultrasonic signals are spectrally analyzed by using HHT, and signal energy distribution in time and frequency can be clearly described.

In its standard form, PCA makes no distinction between data points and the associated measurement errors which vary depending on experimental conditions. A recent and robust solution consists in capturing the variability of the multivariate observations by symbolic data analysis methods, precisely, using interval-valued variables and interval PCA methods. The key idea is to extend the methodology of conventional PCA based statistical process monitoring to handle interval-valued data. In this paper, we compare four most known interval PCA methods and investigate their use for diagnosis purpose. Based on reconstruction principle used in the classical PCA approach, an interval reconstruction is proposed and a new criterion is derived for the determination of the interval PCA model structure (number of retained principal components). The monitoring routine includes the generation of interval residuals for fault detection, and the application of the extended interval reconstruction principle for fault isolation. We also introduce a new set of Shewhart type interval statistics, based on the conventional PCA statistics, that are more suited to interval data-set case with a better overall performances.

Monitoring of electric machinery is one of the most important challenges in predictive maintenance. Adaptive manufacturing processes/plants may be possible through the monitored conditions. In this respect, several attempts have been made to utilize deep learning algorithms for rotating machinery fault detection and diagnosis. Among them, deep autoencoders are very popular, because of their denoising effect. They are also implemented in electric machinery fault diagnostics in order to obtain lower order representation of signals. However, none of these efforts regard the autoencoders as compression units. Bearing in mind that spectra of vibration and current signals that are collected from electric machinery are critical instruments for detection and diagnosis of their faults, we propose that deep stacked autoencoder can be utilized as spectrum compression units. The performance of the proposed strategy are assessed using a bearing data set in three ways: (1)Rule-based classifiers are implemented on raw and compressed-decompressed spectrum and their performance are compared. (2) It is shown that the several machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines, artificial neural networks and k-nearest neighbour classifiers on compressed-decompressed spectrum achieves the performance of them on raw data. (3) A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier is implemented on the low dimensional representation and it is demonstrated that the strategy of employing the same autoencoder as pretraining of feature extraction module cannot outperform the performance of this MLP classifier.

With this model and the corresponding methods, sufficient faults can be handily injected into the circuit under test and then be simulated to construct the sample data. Using these data, a kernel density estimation on ${K}$ -nearest neighbors classification algorithm and its leave-one-out cross-validation method are studied to evaluate the testability metrics. To handle the possible high false alarm caused by the faults that have similar samples with the fault-free case, two strategies are carried out by ignoring the faults in the ambiguity groups or/and using the posterior weights to determine the final classification results. Furthermore, a sample compression approach is proposed to reduce the computational cost.

In the first step, known as failure mapping, failures are mapped to the scan cells from the faulty responses recorded at compressor outputs on the Automatic Test Equipment (ATE). In the second step, normal scan diagnosis-cone tracing and fault simulation-is used to identify the faulty gate/pin/net. Accurate failure mapping is extremely important for successful diagnosis. Unfortunately, due to aliasing and presence of don't cares in the response, no mapping algorithm can guarantee that mapping will always be correct for convolution compressors. In this paper, we proposes a new technique which can handle incorrect mappings (the first step of diagnosis). This feature is shown to provide significant improvement over previous methods. Combining the new proposed techniques to the prior algorithms, we have achieved scan level diagnosis accuracy (99.8%) in a compression environment with extreme low pin compressors. © 2016 IEEE.","Diagnosis with Compressor; Failure Mapping; Matching Score","Automatic testing; Conformal mapping; Convolution; Equipment testing; Aliasing; Automatic test equipment; Don't-cares; Fault simulation; Mapping algorithms; Matching score; Scan cells; Scan diagnosis; Compressors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

There are various methods introduced for condition monitoring such as vibration analysis, temperature analysis, wear and debris analysis. Among these vibration analysis is found to be the most effective method for detection of machine faults. In current work bearing fault detection is done by vibration analysis. Whenever a bearing fault occurs some impact force is generated. This force is responsible for the change in vibration pattern. Here we have studied the vibration pattern for 0.25HP PMDC motor with different load condition. Vibration pattern for good bearing and faulty bearing are analyzed and inner race, outer race bearing faults are detected. It is difficult to detect inner race defect under poor signal to noise ratio (SNR) condition. Hence, there is high demand to detect inner race defect under poor SNR condition wisely. The inner race vibration gets buried into another vibration signal and detection becomes complex. In order to, improve SNR we have used Principle Component Analysis (PCA). This PCA found to be useful to remove Gaussian noise and make detection easier in in poor SNR condition. PCA is basically used as compression technique. As we remove principle components having less contribution noise gets eliminated. Further, we have used wavelet based envelope analysis to extract feature of defects in the bearing of electric motor. This analysis gives advantage over traditional envelope analysis by selecting the most relevant frequency for fault diagnosis. The characteristic frequency of bearing faults can be judged accurately by power spectrum of Hilbert envelope. © 2016 IEEE.","Ball bearing; envelope spectrum; fault detection; PCA; wavelet transform","Ball bearings; Condition monitoring; Defects; Gaussian noise (electronic); Plasma diagnostics; Principal component analysis; Signal to noise ratio; Vibration analysis; Wavelet analysis; Wavelet transforms; Bearing fault detection; Characteristic frequencies; Compression techniques; Envelope spectra; Principle component; Principle component analysis; Temperature analysis; Vibration pattern; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

However, in actual industrial processes, the number of pair copulas to be optimized and the parameters to be estimated increase rapidly when the dimensionality of the variables is large. This greatly increases the computational load and reduces the detection efficiency. In this paper, a fault diagnosis method based on a simplified R-vine (SRV) model is proposed. Without reducing the precision of the model significantly, the simplified level is set to reduce the complexity of the workload and calculations. The simplified level of an R-vine model is obtained by a Vuong test. Then, the generalized local probability (GLP) of the non-Gaussian state is constructed by using the theory of highest density region (HDR) and a density quantile table. The monitoring results of the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and a real acetic acid dehydration distillation system show that the proposed SRV approach achieves good performance in monitoring results and computational load for chemical process fault monitoring. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","","Distillation; Distillation equipment; Fault detection; Process control; Process monitoring; Acetic acid dehydration; Chemical process monitoring; Detection efficiency; Dimensional reduction; Distillation systems; Fault diagnosis method; Highest density regions; Nonlinear and non-Gaussian; Gaussian noise (electronic)","Article","Final","","Scopus"

In recent years, their fault diagnosis, especially under variable, or fluctuant conditions, has received increasing attention. Sufficient monitoring data are usually required for bearing diagnosis. However, sufficient data cannot be guaranteed in some engineering cases with limitations of the transmission channel bandwidth or onboard/onsite computational capabilities. Fortunately, the emerging compressed sensing technique, which provides an effective solution to data compression and processing, has the ability to transform traditional monitoring data to the compressed information domain for a highly effective diagnosis under fluctuant conditions. This study proposes a bearing fault diagnosis method under fluctuant conditions based on compressed sensing theory. First, a random matrix is constructed as the measurement matrix and is employed to compress the original signal into the compressed information domain. Then, reconstruction-evaluation based fault diagnosis method is conducted with compressed signals. Moreover, the compressed signals used for fault diagnosis are reconstructed on the remote side. The experimental results provide evidence that the proposed method can effectively reduce the data volume required for bearing diagnosis and maintain an accuracy similar to current approaches, and the reconstructed signals can be used for other fault diagnosis methods.

However, in some cases, the bandwidth of the wireless communication is limited, and the volume of transmitted data is limited by bandwidth. Therefore, raw data are usually compressed before transmission. Different to traditional data compression method, in this study, bearing data is compressed based on Compressive Sensing theory. With this technique, data could be collected and compressed simultaneously, and then it could be recovered in remote side. Unfortunately, when using the compressed data, the accuracy and stability of fault diagnosis could be discounted. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a two-stage matching pursuit algorithm for on-board bearing fault diagnosis. First, we set up a complete database using historical bearing data of all working conditions and fault patterns. Second, Gaussian random matrix was applied to compress the target bearing data and then similarity pursuit was implemented to get the Similar Samples. Third, the Similar Samples were used to construct dictionary matrix. Then, matching pursuit algorithm based on Compressive Sensing was introduced to reconstruct the target sample. Finally, classification reconstruction was conducted to recognize the fault pattern of the target bearing data. In addition, some experiments were conducted to demonstrate that proposed method is working well for bearing under different working conditions. © 2017 IEEE.","bearing fault diagnosis; Compressive Sensing; data compression; different working conditions","Bandwidth; Big data; Channel estimation; Compressed sensing; Condition monitoring; Data compression; Failure analysis; Matrix algebra; Systems engineering; Wireless telecommunication systems; Bearing condition monitoring; Bearing fault diagnosis; Compression methods; Compressive sensing; different working conditions; Gaussian random matrices; Matching pursuit algorithms; Wireless communications; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

However, security of these algorithms is not guaranteed in the presence of malicious and natural faults. Recently, a new lightweight block cipher, Midori, has been proposed that optimizes the energy consumption besides having low latency and hardware complexity. In this paper, fault diagnosis schemes for variants of Midori are proposed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no fault diagnosis scheme presented in the literature for Midori to date. The fault diagnosis schemes are provided for the nonlinear S-box layer and for the round structures with both 64-bit and 128-bit Midori symmetric key ciphers. The proposed schemes are benchmarked on a field-programmable gate array and their error coverage is assessed with fault-injection simulations.

With reflux flow (L), vapor flow (V), feed composition (zF) and feed flow (F) as examples, an inversion method was used to establish an inversion model between the disturbance and Euclidean distances based on single variable perturbation. The disturbance could then be analyzed by mathematic calculation. This method was used as an operation rule and embedded into expert systems. The efficacy of the proposed strategy was demonstrated by a high-purity binary distillation column system. © 2016, Editorial Board of “Journal of Chemical Engineering of Chinese Universities”.

This is achieved through the application of integrated fault-tolerant model predictive control and fault-tolerant inferential control to respectively accommodate actuator and sensor faults during operation, hence maintaining the integrity of the operation. An interactive dynamic system is developed by integrating an HYSYS crude distillation model with MATLAB to simulate the system for normal and various actuator and sensor faults. Operations of the crude distillation unit is monitored for actuator and sensor faults through MATLAB using the developed dynamic principal component analysis based diagnostics model with data collected during normal operation. When an actuator fault is diagnosed, fault-tolerant model predictive control is applied to restructure the remaining healthy actuators based on pre-assessed control structure reconfiguration. FTIC is applied to accommodate sensor faults when diagnosed using a dynamic partial least square based soft-sensor estimates of the measured controlled variable in place of the faulty sensor outputs. Application results on a simulated crude distillation unit attest to the efficacy of the proposed approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","crude distillation; dynamic partial least squares; fault detection and diagnosis; fault-tolerant inferential control; Fault-tolerant model predictive control","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus"

There exist strong interdependencies between various units. Once any unit fails, it often triggers cascade failures as a chain reaction, resulting in significant production losses and catastrophic accidents (such as SEVESO, BOPHAL Disaster, etc.). Fault diagnosis methodologies can unveil early deviations in the fault causal chain. Two main issues exist that are how to describe the interdependency in such complex system, and how to discover the root causes of the current abnormal event to support maintenance. Meanwhile in order to reduce the fault impact to the plants, quickly diagnosis of the root cause of the fault is also quite necessary. In this paper, aiming to solve above issues, granger causality test is introduced to study the fault interdependency by analyzing the relationship between process parameters of petrochemical units and establishing an effect diagram of the process parameters. When alarm occurs on condition monitoring system, the effect relationship diagram of the process parameters is used to elect related process parameters which haven't exceed the alarming threshold but may indicate an incipient fault. Then the granger causality test is used on the selected parameters to do the test pairwise. According to the degree of the causal relationship of the process parameters, the fault quantitative cause and effect diagram can be established. By using the quantitative cause and effect diagram, the path with the biggest quantitative value of causal relationship can be considered as the most probable fault propagation path in the petrochemical units according to the current alarm. In this way the root cause of the alarm can be revealed easily. The pilot application for FCCU and atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit in the case studies validates the effectiveness of the proposed method and its application value in the petrochemical industry. © 2017 IEEE.","fault diagnosis; fault propagation; granger causality test; petrochemical plant","Accidents; Alarm systems; Chains; Condition monitoring; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Failure analysis; Flowcharting; Fuzzy systems; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; Statistical tests; Atmospheric and vacuum distillations; Catastrophic accidents; Causal relationships; Cause-and-Effect diagram; Fault propagation; Granger causality test; On condition monitoring; Petrochemical industry; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The traditional K-SVD algorithm requires high time consumption in the dictionary update process, and the data compression efficiency is low, particularly in the massive vibration data compression, so an improved algorithm is proposed for K-SVD dictionary update. Starting from the number of columns in the dictionary participating the update in single iteration process, the improved algorithm assigns values to the atoms in several columns of the dictionary after each singular value decomposition, so that the computation burdens of single iteration are reduced. At the same time, the optimal number of columns of dictionary update is determined according to the iteration convergence number, time consumption and peak signal to noise ratio of reconstruction of different number of columns in sparse decomposition process. Experiment results show that traditional K-SVD algorithm has a low efficiency for the vibration signal data compression, and the improved algorithm can effectively shorten the dictionary training time consumption under the premise of ensuring the signal compression ratio and reconstruction effects. © 2016, Science Press.

In order to reduce the problems related to strong coupling in these processes, the search for the incorporation of artificial intelligence devices has shown an increasing trend in recent years. Due to this complexity and control in multivariable processes, diagnosis and fault monitoring in the processes have become increasingly difficult. Therefore, the application of these devices has achieved satisfactory results regarding the procedures performed with human operators. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a signal separation technique that is based on the use of higher order statistics to estimate each of the unknown sources, through observation of various mixtures generated from these sources. Although there are recent works on using the ICA in industrial processes, few studies have been made in cases involving distillation columns. This paper proposes a control strategy based on the ICA technique, which makes the control loops decoupled and hence the performance easier. Compared to the conventional method, the technique provided a great improvement in control performance.

In order to better control the train operational status by timely and rapid detection of faults, we need new methods to handle and analyze the huge volumes of high-speed railway data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and platform for high-speed train fault diagnosis based on big data technologies. The framework aims to allow researchers to focus on fault detection algorithm development and on-line application, with all the complexities of big data import, storage, management, and realtime use handled transparently by the framework. The framework uses a combination of cloud computing and edge computing and a two-level architecture that handles the massive data of train operations. The platform uses Hadoop as its basic framework and combines HDFS, HBase, Redis and MySQL database as the data storage framework. A lossless data compression method is presented to reduce the data storage space and improve data storage efficiency. In order to support various types of data analysis tasks for fault diagnosis and prognosis, the framework integrates online computation, off-line computation, stream computation, real-time computation and so on. Moreover, the platform provides fault diagnosis and prognosis as services to users and a simple case study is given to further illustrate how the basic functions of the platform are implemented. © 2018","Big Data; Cloud Computing; Edge Computing; Fault Diagnosis; High-Speed Train","Big data; Cloud computing; Data streams; Digital storage; Edge computing; Electric fault currents; Failure analysis; Information management; Railroad cars; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Speed; Diagnosis and prognosis; Fault detection algorithm; Framework and platform; High - speed railways; High speed train (HST); Lossless data compression method; On-line applications; Real-time computations; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Methods and Materials: Patients with primary or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer with or without pathologic verification, with tumors <3 cm, treated with SBRT (isocenter prescription of 48 Gy in 4 fractions) between April 1998 and August 2014, and with >6 months’ follow-up were eligible. The LR rate was calculated by the cumulative incidence function, accounting for death as a competing risk. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify prognostic factors for LR. Results: A total of 216 patients and 230 tumors were analyzed. The median follow-up time of tumors without LR was 3.9 years, and the crude number of LR cases was 49 (21%). The actuarial rate of LR was 19% (95% confidence interval, 14%-25%) at 5 years. The number of LR cases in each period was 10 in year 1, 17 in year 2, 9 in year 3, 3 in year 4, 3 in year 5, and 7 after 5 years. Among 73 tumors with >5 years’ follow-up, we observed 7 late LRs. The tumor histology of these late LRs was adenocarcinoma in 3, squamous cell carcinoma in 2, and unknown in 2 (1 of the unknown cases was confirmed as adenocarcinoma following salvage surgery). The median time to LR was 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.5-4.2 years) for adenocarcinoma compared with 1.3 years (interquartile range, 1.0-2.3 years) for squamous cell carcinoma. Multivariate analysis revealed that larger tumor size, squamous cell histology compared with adenocarcinoma, and use of abdominal compression for respiratory motion management were independent negative prognostic factors for LR. Conclusions: Long-term follow-up data demonstrated that late LR was not uncommon and that careful follow-up after SBRT is needed, especially in patients with adenocarcinoma. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","","Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Confidence Intervals; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Radiosurgery; Retrospective Studies; Salvage Therapy; Time Factors; Tumor Burden; Biological organs; Cells; Cytology; Diseases; Factor analysis; Fault tolerant computer systems; Histology; Multivariant analysis; Natural language processing systems; Tumors; Cumulative incidence; Inter quartile ranges; Long-term follow-up study; Methods and materials; Multi variate analysis; Non small cell lung cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma; Stereotactic body radiation therapy; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer incidence; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; female; follow up; histopathology; human; lung adenocarcinoma; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; priority journal; radiation dose; retrospective study; salvage therapy; squamous cell lung carcinoma; stereotactic body radiation therapy; tumor volume; adenocarcinoma; analysis of variance; confidence interval; incidence; lung tumor; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; radiosurgery; squamous cell carcinoma; time factor; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Radiotherapy","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The main idea is to record (store) all required compressed test data in a novel scan chain structure, and extract and decompress them during testing. This requires a very high compression ratio to obtain a low test data volume, that is, smaller than the number of scan cells in the circuit under test. To achieve such a high compression ratio, we propose a novel compression method that combines broadcast scan as well as a tailored single-input compression architecture. We also utilize the concept of scan chain partitioning and clock gating to reduce the test time and test power. An on-chip test controller is employed to automatically generate all required control signals for the whole test procedure. This significantly reduces the requirements on external automatic test equipment. Experimental results show that our method is well suitable for multicore designs. For example, experiments on the 8-core open-source OpenSPARC T2 processor with 5.7M gates show that all required test data for 100% testable stuck-at fault coverage can be stored in just 59.4% of the scan cells of the processor. Experimental results for transition faults are also presented, which show that more identical cores are needed in order to store all test data for transition faults. We also discuss how to extend this paper to address fault diagnosis and engineering change order problems. © 2018 IEEE.","Built-in self-test; on-chip testing; scan data recording; systems-on-chip (SOCs) testing; test compression","Chains; Clocks; Computer architecture; Data compression ratio; Data mining; Fault detection; Integrated circuit testing; Programmable logic controllers; Scanning; Semiconductor device manufacture; System-on-chip; Circuit faults; Compression methods; Engineering change orders; High compression ratio; On chips; Scan chain partitioning; SOC testing; Test compression; Built-in self test","Article","Final","","Scopus"

Mechanical vibration signals can be converted to time–frequency images using wavelet transform, so machinery fault diagnosis can be transformed to the problem of image classification. Label consistent K-SVD algorithm has been proven to be effective in image classification, which incorporates a label consistent term namely discriminative sparse code error into the objective function. Therefore, in this paper, a novel bearing fault diagnosis method based on wavelet time–frequency image and label consistent K-SVD is proposed. Firstly, continuous wavelet transform is utilized to generate wavelet time–frequency images that can fully reflect bearing fault characteristics. Then texture feature extraction based on gray level co-occurrence matrix is implemented on the wavelet time–frequency images. Finally, label consistent K-SVD is conducted for classification of the time–frequency images, and thus bearing fault diagnosis is realized. The experiment results show that the texture features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix of wavelet time–frequency images can effectively extract the fault characteristics of rolling bearings, and label consistent K-SVD performs better than other classification methods based on dictionary learning under the same parameters. © IMechE 2017.","dictionary learning; fault diagnosis; label consistent K-SVD; rolling bearing; time–frequency image; Wavelet transform","Computer aided diagnosis; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Image classification; Image compression; Roller bearings; Textures; Vibrations (mechanical); Wavelet transforms; Continuous Wavelet Transform; Dictionary learning; Frequency image; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Machinery fault diagnosis; Mechanical vibration signals; Rolling bearings; Texture feature extraction; Image texture","Article","Final","","Scopus"

The network operators and SDN developers often need to reason about the network forwarding behavior and localize the unpredicted network failures. The existing approaches for tracing packet trajectories in an SDN environment either incur large data collection overhead or trade off the data plane resources to satisfy pre-specified queries. This paper introduces PathSeer, a lightweight and scalable technique for tracing packet trajectories in SDN-enabled datacenters. PathSeer leverages OpenFlow features to reuse some fields in the packet header for encoding the path of the traced packet. It is designed as an SDN tool running on the centralized network controller.

However, due to the macro-structural disturbance and background noise interference, it is not easy to mine the transient features, especially at the apparent failure stage. Meanwhile, the actual mechanism of bearing fault detect can be not simply expressed by the formulated theory models without consideration of the actual physical collision process. To overcome these issues, motivated by the merits of time-frequency manifold (TFM), this paper proposes a new transient feature extraction method, called parallel time-frequency manifold (PTFM) filtering, by simultaneously using TFM-based reconstruction with TFM-based filter in parallel for transient feature extraction. First, to improve the computational efficiency of TFM, two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform is employed on the raw time-frequency distribution (TFD) with image compression. TFM learning is later used to mine the principle manifolds from those approximation sub-images. Then, the amplitudes of the raw time-frequency image can be reconstructed by TFM feature bases while the desired location of time-frequency feature can be captured by TFM morphology filter in a process of image morphology. With raw time-frequency phases in a series of inverse processes, the de-noised signal can be finally synthesized from these filtered images. The proposed method accomplishes a natural manifold feature denoising by combining the sparse theory with image morphology, and demonstrates attractive prospects in the following three aspects: signal de-noising with a self-learning mode in the view of image morphology processing combined with sparse theory, fault diagnosis with in-band noise/close interference removal, and machine health monitoring with capability in capturing sensitive failure information. Simulations and experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed PTFM filtering method in noise suppression and feature enhancement, which is valuable for bearing health monitoring and diagnosis applications. © 2013 IEEE.","fault diagnosis; image morphology filtering; parallel time-frequency manifold filtering; Sparse representation; time-frequency image","Bearings (machine parts); Computation theory; Computational efficiency; Discrete wavelet transforms; Extraction; Failure analysis; Feature extraction; Health; Image compression; Image enhancement; Inverse problems; Morphology; Signal analysis; Signal denoising; Transient analysis; Image morphology; Machine health monitoring; Sparse representation; Time frequency; Time frequency manifolds (TFM); Time-frequency distributions; Time-frequency images; Two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Instead, we take fault diagnosis as a regression problem to figure out fault severity. A simple time-domain method extracts features directly from original signal. Then features are put into weighted support vector regression(WSVR). Since the whole diagnosis process is simple, the number of parameters needed to be tuned is small.Our ODD model has a good performance on operating mechanism fault severity diagnosis. The no-load test results show that the maximum diagnostic error for coil power supply voltage fault is less than 8% of rated voltage.

The most common failure mode in the compressor is valve leakage. Generally, leakage fault is considered to be of little harm to machines. However, it was found that the serious leakage of the valve would cause abnormal bending vibration of the piston rod and accelerate the formation of fatigue cracks. Most researchers utilized the signal of cylinder dynamic pressure, valve temperature or acoustic emission to diagnose valve leakage fault. However, each of these methods has disadvantages. In this paper, a new method is proposed to diagnose valve leakage fault using vibration signal. The main idea is that the severity of valve leakage can be assessed by analyzing energy of the main frequency band during compression process and the delay of discharge valve opening. Firstly, the vibration signal in the time domain is segmented into several angle-domain signals according to the keyphasor signal. Each of the angle-domain signals corresponds to one cylinder working cycle. Then, the time-frequency analysis is conducted with the Gaussian window, and the main energy frequency band and the compression process are determined. Filtering the signal with a bandpass filter based on the main energy frequency band, and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the filtered signal during compression process is calculated in a crank revolution. Besides, the angle of discharge valve opening is detected. Based on the two indicators, the severity of valve leakage can be estimated. To verify the effectiveness of the method, keyphasor of the flywheel, cylinder dynamic pressure and vibration acceleration of valve are acquired on a double-acting oil-free air compressor under different degrees of suction valve leakage. The experimental results and analysis show that the proposed method can well identify the valve leakage fault, even in the case of weak leakage, and is very effective in quantifying the severity of leakage.

The period-energy feature and LMD feature were extracted from the intercepted signal. Third, the features were processed by u-law compression-expansion and moving-average processing. Finally, two Rolling bearing fault (RBFs) were designed with the same precision.

The AE signal has high frequencies up to several MHz which can avoid some signals interference, such as the parts of bearing (i.e. rolling elements, ring and so on) and other rotating parts of machine. However, acoustic emission signal necessitates advanced signal sampling capabilities and requests ability to deal with large amounts of sampling data. In this paper, compressive sensing (CS) is introduced as a processing framework, and then a compressive features extraction method is proposed. We use it for extracting the compressive features from compressively-sensed data directly, and also prove the energy preservation properties. First, we study the AE signals under the CS framework. The sparsity of AE signal of the rolling bearing is checked. The observation and reconstruction of signal is also studied. Second, we present a method of extraction AE compressive feature (AECF) from compressively-sensed data directly. We demonstrate the energy preservation properties and the processing of the extracted AECF feature. We assess the running state of the bearing using the AECF trend. The AECF trend of the running state of rolling bearings is consistent with the trend of traditional features. Thus, the method is an effective way to evaluate the running trend of rolling bearings. The results of the experiments have verified that the signal processing and the condition assessment based on AECF is simpler, the amount of data required is smaller, and the amount of computation is greatly reduced. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emission; Compressive feature; Compressive sensing; State assessment","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Bearings (machine parts); Compressed sensing; Damage detection; Data compression; Extraction; Fault detection; Signal processing; Signal reconstruction; Signal sampling; Acoustic emission signal; Compressive feature; Compressive sensing; Condition assessments; Features extraction; High frequency HF; Rolling bearings; State assessment; Roller bearings","Article","Final","","Scopus"

There exist strong interdependencies between various units. Once any unit fails, it often triggers cascade failures as a chain reaction, resulting in significant production losses and catastrophic accidents. Fault diagnosis methodologies can unveil early deviations in the fault causal chain. Two main issues exist that are how to describe the interdependency in such complex system, and how to discover the root causes of the current abnormal event to support maintenance. Meanwhile in order to reduce the fault impact to the plants, quickly diagnosis of the root cause of the fault is also quite necessary. In this paper, aiming to solve above issues, granger causality test is introduced to study the fault interdependency by analyzing the relationship between process parameters of petrochemical units and establishing an effect diagram of the process parameters. When alarm occurs on condition monitoring system, the effect relationship diagram of the process parameters is used to elect related process parameters which haven't exceed the alarming threshold but may indicate an incipient fault. Then the granger causality test is used on the selected parameters to do the test pairwise. According to the degree of the causal relationship of the process parameters, the fault quantitative cause and effect diagram can be established. By using the quantitative cause and effect diagram, the path with the biggest quantitative value of causal relationship can be considered as the most probable fault propagation path in the petrochemical units according to the current alarm. In this way the root cause of the alarm can be revealed easily. The pilot application for atmospheric and vacuum distillation unit in the case studies validates the effectiveness of the proposed method and its application value in the petrochemical industry.","Fault diagnosis; Fault propagation; Granger causality test; Petrochemical plant","Alarm systems; Chains; Condition monitoring; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Failure analysis; Flowcharting; Petrochemical plants; Petrochemicals; Statistical tests; Testing; Atmospheric and vacuum distillations; Catastrophic accidents; Causal relationships; Cause-and-Effect diagram; Fault propagation; Granger causality test; On condition monitoring; Petrochemical industry; Fault detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

Additionally, it can also extract the individual components, called intrinsic mode functions or IMFs, of a non-stationary multi-component signal, akin to empirical mode decomposition. The rich mathematical structure based on continuous wavelet transform makes SST a promising candidate for gearbox diagnosis. This work utilizes the decomposing power of SST to extract the IMFs from gearbox signals. For robust detection of faults in gear-motors, a fault detection technique based on time-varying autoregressive coefficients of IMFs as features is utilized. Sequential Karhunen-Loeve transform is employed on the condition indicators to select the appropriate window sizes on which SST can be applied.

Active side-channel analysis attacks (SCAs) such as fault analysis attacks and passive ones, e.g., power analysis attacks, have been effective to compromise algorithmically-secure crypto-solutions including the emerging lightweight block ciphers. Nevertheless, one can provide fault diagnosis approaches to ameliorate the former and use efficient masking mechanisms for the latter. There has been recent work to account for power analysis attacks resistivity before developing new lightweight block ciphers; nonetheless, in this paper, we present error detection approaches for such ciphers and present insights towards future directions for potential, combined power and fault analysis attacks resistivity as a major deciding factor in developing SCA-resistant lightweight block ciphers. Through error simulations, the theoretical back-bone of the presented error detection scheme for a lightweight block cipher case study is benchmarked.

To overcome the aforementioned shortcoming, a two-stage compressed fault detection strategy is proposed in this study. First, a sliding window is utilized to divide the original signals into several segments and a selected symptom parameter is employed to represent each segment, through which a symptom parameter wave can be obtained and the raw vibration signals are compressed to a certain level with the faulty information remaining. Second, a fault detection scheme based on the compressed sensing is applied to extract the fault features, which can compress the symptom parameter wave thoroughly with a random matrix called the measurement matrix. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the comparison of the three selected symptom parameters is also presented in this paper. © 2016 Huaqing Wang et al.","","Big data; Compressed sensing; Condition monitoring; Matrix algebra; Roller bearings; Rollers (machine components); Signal detection; Signal processing; Data measurements; Fault detection schemes; Measurement matrix; Roller bearing fault; Shannon Sampling Theorem; Symptom parameters; Two stage compression; Vibration signal; Fault detection","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The aim of the control system is to maintain the binary distillation process (ethanol-water) in continuous operation even if both sensors or actuator fault occurs. To develop the active fault tolerant control system, it was designed a fault detection and diagnosis system by using a full-order high-gain observer to estimate the temperatures and concentrations on the distillation column; the estimation of the temperatures and concentrations was made by using only one measured temperature. Also, there were employed three adaptive observers, one is used to estimate the vapor pressure, the other two observers are used to estimate a parameter in each actuator, in that way is estimated the size, instant and magnitude of the fault. The active fault tolerant system is based on the compensation of the fault based on the information given by the fault detection and diagnosis system. The fault tolerant in sensor is based in the reconfiguration of the faulty sensor. The main contribution of this work is that proposed scheme is able to detect and diagnosis, multiple and simultaneous failures in sensors and at least in one actuator. The simulation test shows that the control law allows that the liquid molar concentrations required in distillates, follow the reference properly, even in presence of faults. © 2015 CEA.

Efficient trade off among minimum performance and implementation metrics and high level of security for cryptosystems in constrained applications has led to proposed error detection schemes for lightweight block ciphers. These ciphers provide low-cost confidentiality in terms of low hardware complexity and fast implementation. In this paper, we propose fault diagnosis schemes for an efficient lightweight block cipher, RECTANGLE, to ensure high level of security with low hardware overhead incorporated for error detection. This cipher offers efficient performance in both hardware and software implementation using bit-slice techniques. To the best of authors' knowledge, no prior error detection scheme has been presented in literature for RECTANGLE to date. The proposed error detection schemes that are provided for the S-box layer, Player, and for the round structures with 80-bit or 128-bit key sizes, are benchmarked on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware platform to assess their suitability. The error coverage of these schemes is close to 100% (assessed with fault injection simulation) and the induced overheads are low, increasing the reliability of the hardware architectures of RECTANGLE. © 2016 IEEE.","Bit-slice lightweight block cipher; field-programmable gate array (FPGA); reliability","Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Geometry; Logic gates; Security of data; Signal receivers; Bit-slice lightweight block cipher; Block ciphers; CryptoGraphics; Detection scheme; Fault diagnosis schemes; Field programmables; Field-programmable gate array; Lightweight block ciphers; Performance; Programmable gate array; Error detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus"

The conventional approach to estimate drifting parameters is to model them as a random walk process and estimate them simultaneously with the states. However, this may lead to a poorly conditioned problem, where the tuning of the random walk model becomes a non-trivial exercise. Recently, Huang et al. (2010) has proposed a novel moving window weighted least squares parameter estimation approach, which is capable of simultaneous estimation of states and slowly drifting parameters/unmeasured disturbances. The slowly drifting parameters are assumed to remain constant in a time window in the immediate past and are estimated by solving a constrained minimization problem formulated over the window. In this work, the moving window parameter estimator of Huang et al. (2010) is recast as a moving window maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. It is assumed that the innovation sequence generated by the DAE-EKF is a Gaussian white noise process and further used to construct a likelihood function that treats the drifting model parameters as unknowns. This leads to a well conditioned problem where the only tuning parameter is the length of the moving window, which is much easier to select than selecting the covariance of the random walk model. Efficacy of the proposed ML formulation has been demonstrated by conducting simulation studies on an ideal reactive distillation system. Analysis of the simulation results reveals that the proposed moving window ML estimator is capable of tracking the drifting unmeasured parameter fairly accurately using only the tray temperature measurements. © 2016","Extended Kalman Filter; Maximum Likelihood Estimation; Parameter Estimation; Reactive Distillation; State","Constrained optimization; Distillation; Distillation equipment; Distilleries; Extended Kalman filters; Maximum likelihood estimation; Process monitoring; Random processes; Temperature measurement; White noise; Constrained minimization problem; Conventional approach; Maximum likelihood estimator; Reactive distillation systems; Reactive distillations; Simultaneous estimation; State; Weighted least squares; Parameter estimation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

These faults appear as impulses at periodic intervals resulting in form of specific characteristic frequencies. However, the characteristic frequencies are submerged in noise causing by a result of small imperfections in the balance or smoothness of the components of the bearing. To retrieve the characteristic fault frequencies of the vibration signal, signal denoising is an essential processing step in fault diagnosis of the bearings. This paper presents time-frequency analysis and nonlinear manifold learning technique for denoising vibration signals corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. According to keeping the computing time acceptable, a novel manifold learning denoising method is put forward combining data compression and reconstruct operations. Simulation and experiments are employed to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method on bearing vibration signals. Furthermore, this method can be used in other fault detection fields, such as engine, suspension device, and vehicle structures. © JVE INTERNATIONAL LTD.","Bearing; Manifold learning; Time-frequency analysis; Vibration signals denoising","Gaussian noise (electronic); Learning systems; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Signal denoising; Vibration analysis; White noise; Bearing; Bearing failures; Bearing vibrations; Characteristic-frequency; Denoising methods; Manifold learning; Rotating machine; Time-frequency Analysis; Vibration signal; Vibration signal denoising; Fault detection","Article","Final","","Scopus"
