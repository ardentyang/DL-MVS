# Deep learning models for mechanical vibration signals

Since 2016, methods based on deep neural networks have become popular in the field of mechanical fault diagnosis. During my research, I reproduced the deep learning models proposed in some literature in this field. I look forward to communicating or discussing with you who are looking at this project so as to correct errors or make improvements.
